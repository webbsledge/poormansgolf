Speaker A: Previously on Chasing Scratch.
Speaker B: I think you have to go back and hit your driver a million times over the next month before Myrtle.
Speaker A: Oh, wow. Look at that angle of your stomach.
Speaker B: Okay, first of all, that wasn't what you said. You went, that's not a good angle. And there was no laughing about it. And then you said, let's all just say it. We all know you're big right now.
Speaker A: No, no, listen. It's all out of love. That is what you said. That is what you said, christina. Well, it's all out of love because I love you and I care about your health. We are two guys in our mid thirties. We have wives, kids, jobs, adult responsibilities, and shaky eleven handicaps. And we're trying to get those handicaps to scratch in a year. This is chasing scratch. Episode six, the tweener. Okay, this is Mike.
Speaker B: This is Eli.
Speaker A: And before we start today, Eli, I think you need to own up to a mistake that you made in our last episode. What was that? You need to apologize to Carl Weathers.
Speaker B: Does this have anything to do with Rambo and Predator?
Speaker A: Yes, you actually. You need to apologize to me, too, because I said predator, and you said, no, you're wrong. It's Rambo.
Speaker B: You're right.
Speaker A: And after further review, it is predator. And I think you need to make this right.
Speaker B: That's right, Carl. Maybe we could cue some. Some deeply personal apologetic music.
Speaker A: Let's do that, Carl.
Speaker B: I, uh. First off, I'm sorry for pronouncing your last name withers.
Speaker A: Like you were ridiculous, by the way.
Speaker B: Like you. Like you were a Simpsons character or.
Speaker A: Like he was withering.
Speaker B: In no way. In no way was that meant to reflect what's happened to your acting career or to your body, post drago. I also in no way meant to lump you in in Rambo as opposed to predator. And I hope you'll find it in your heart of hearts to forgive me. Whew.
Speaker A: Okay. I feel. I feel better now. I think we can move on.
Speaker B: I feel lighter.
Speaker A: Lighter. Okay. It's good. All right. Well, this episode is called the tweener because we are covering roughly the three and a half weeks in between the golf trip to Vegas. Excuse me, the couples trip to Vegas.
Speaker B: It was always a couple's trip, couples.
Speaker A: Trip where we happen to play golf and then another golf trip that we scheduled to Myrtle beach. So we had an in between time of three and a half weeks. And we originally weren't planning to do an episode covering this time, but it turns out a lot happened in those three weeks. So coming out of Vegas, we had some takeaways. I had the same takeaway I've had for about nine months, which is learn how to hit driver. And then you pledged that you're gonna work on your short game.
Speaker B: That's right.
Speaker A: And then you were also going to try a diet. That's correct. And maybe we should start there, because coming out of Vegas, you were motivated. There was the twist picture incident. There was your wife coming off the top rope. Mm hmm.
Speaker B: In what has been the definition of honesty hour, she absolutely leveled me with a series of just knockout punches. It was amazing. I even got up after them, got up off the mat after any of them, but I did, and I'm happy to report, I believe I'm about 30 plus days into this, and I have not broken this.
Speaker A: This pact.
Speaker B: It started off as a three week. As a three week commitment in between golf trips, to cut out anything other than water, to go, water only to go, no fast food breakfast, and to go, no eating after dinner.
Speaker A: I think we might just need to stop right there just to make sure the listening audience understands, because maybe that doesn't sound as extreme as it really is, because, first of all, how many times before this three and a half weeks. How many times would you say you averaged per week eating fast food breakfast? Five. Five. And I can tell you your order. Sausage, egg, and cheese value meal with a large coke. At McDonald's, you're slightly off.
Speaker B: It's bacon, egg, and cheese. But don't ever insult me with a sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit. Also, you know, at this point in time, it's probably. It's probably. I just like to make a plug to McDonald's. McDonald's. And Mike can attest to this. I invented a breakfast sandwich probably, what was it, 13 years ago? 13 years ago. And I have been waiting for this sandwich to pick up steam, but it has not, and you all have yet to develop it on your menu. Now, I dubbed it. I dubbed it the heart attack breakfast sandwich. This was a bacon, egg, and cheese McGriddle with sausage added. And I used to eat it every single morning with a large coconut hashbrown. But I'm honestly upset at McDonald's right now for not having implemented this menu item. It had everything you wanted in a breakfast sandwich. It had pancake batter. It had syrup. It had every part of a pig that you could possibly chop up and fry in a pan and eat. It had eggs. So you could at least convince yourself there was one decent thing in there, and then it had a pound of expired american cheese. It honestly frustrates me that this sandwich was not picked up.
Speaker A: All right, so that was one part is no, no fast food breakfast, which you successfully did, which is amazing.
Speaker B: It was amazing.
Speaker A: And then no soda. Again, that doesn't sound that crazy, but what would you say your average ounces of soda per day? 60.
Speaker B: Oh, no, no. It was way more than that. It was probably like 80 to 100. It was like 80 to 180 to 100.
Speaker A: There's no way.
Speaker B: I'm dead serious. Well, think about it. How many ounces are in a large, large coke at McDonald's?
Speaker A: I have no idea.
Speaker B: 24, probably 24. So I had at least 24 for breakfast. That was before 830. And then, and then I would normally have at least another 20 to 25 at lunch. And then I had, at dinner, I always had two glasses of coke. And then I always had coke as a snack at night. It was easily 80 to 100. I've determined. Have you seen the Bruce Willis movie Unbreakable, where he's like this comic book character that survives a train wreck? Not. We've discussed the fact that my doctor cleared my blood test a couple years ago, magically. I went to the dentist two months ago for the first time in a while, and I literally went in with a novocaine needle loaded, and just handed it to him right in the chair. He said, how are you doing? And I handed him the needle, and I said, let's just not waste any time.
Speaker A: Get out of the drill.
Speaker B: I said, just go ahead. If there's a mask around here, you can gas me out and just go ahead and do it, and let's get it over with. And he checked my teeth. He checked my teeth. And he literally said, and you must brush all the time. He said, I don't tell anybody this.
Speaker A: I'm crying.
Speaker B: He said, but he said, I'm telling you, you don't need to get your teeth clean for at least another year. Somebody needs, like, can I fact, can I credential check these people?
Speaker A: I was just about to say, I'm not sure this has as much to do with your unbreakableness as it does with the education quality that the Kentucky dentists and doctors have received. It's.
Speaker B: It's baffling. He cleared me and told me, don't come back for a year.
Speaker A: All right, so that's two parts of the plan. It's already sounding impossible. But then you had to eliminate also the after dinner snacks.
Speaker B: That's right.
Speaker A: Orange again.
Speaker B: Or as our friend colliers dubbed it, my fourth meal.
Speaker A: Fourth meal. Fourth meal. So you took out fourth meal. But. And just. Let's just give some examples of what fourth meal was at. Normally between ten and eleven at night.
Speaker B: Fourth meal was either a dozen Krispy Kreme donuts. I wouldn't eat all dozen at one sitting, but I'd eat enough.
Speaker A: I know sometimes there's a gigantic homemade milkshake.
Speaker B: It was probably a 20 ounce chocolate milkshake. Hershey's syrup, naturally. It was a bowl of popcorn with my kids fruit snacks just dumped into the middle of it.
Speaker A: You dumped. You didn't dump gummy snacks into the popcorn?
Speaker B: Two packs of dinosaur fruit snacks right into the middle of the popcorn.
Speaker A: Are you serious?
Speaker B: I'm dead serious. You eat them at the same time. That's another thing. Is somebody not. Why is nobody writing these ideas down? I've invented a soda. I'm inventing a snack, and I've invented a sandwich for breakfast.
Speaker A: Popcorn with gummy bears.
Speaker B: Can we get an intern that just.
Speaker A: Listens to these food ideas I have?
Speaker B: There's a gold mine out there.
Speaker A: Wow. All right, so I think the listening audience now has a picture of how insane this plan was.
Speaker B: Oh, it was.
Speaker A: It was a.
Speaker B: It was an insane plan for me.
Speaker A: But you actually took some. Some journal footage as you went. So let's. Let's. Let's listen to how you did.
Speaker B: Today is day five of the plan to extend my life beyond 39 years. Today would typically be cheat day on any other dieting slash workout regimen, but I'm trying not to do that today. Did I have thoughts about picking up a bag of McDonald's trash and just licking the cellophane wrapper? I did. Just. Just for a taste of McDonald's breakfast. That way I could say I wasn't eating anything. I was just licking a bag. It's gonna be a battle today. Day eight in the books. I'm leaving the gym. It is 945 at night. It was me and a bunch of Kappa gamma Delta ray beta thetas, pump and iron. The only difference was they were going out for a mixer, and I was trying to get into the steam room to lose weight. I'm battling right now. If this thing doesn't result in a lower handicap, I promise you, I'm right back on pop and pizza the rest of my life.
Speaker A: I got a message from you that says, I'm struggling. Get a message from your wife ten minutes later or five minutes later. And she said, please text Eli. He's about to eat.
Speaker B: Like I'm an alcoholic. Like I'm getting ready to just go out and on a bender and gamble all our money away.
Speaker A: Do not let him eat. He's doing so well. But, but, so let's, let's get to the final outcome. We went to Myrtle. So af the, in these three and a half weeks, you did not cheat once, right?
Speaker B: Not one time.
Speaker A: Really, at the end of the day, I mean, it was a miracle. And how many pounds were you down when we went to Myrtle? I think I was down 1313 pounds in 25 days.
Speaker B: 25 days. But, and I should also mention I started lifting and doing cardio five days a week.
Speaker A: I mean, how much of this was the twist picture?
Speaker B: A good chunk.
Speaker A: Was, was that taped to your mirror? Like, like drago was in Rocky's. Rocky's bathroom in Russia? I'm not going to lie.
Speaker B: It was, it was a good motivator. It served its purpose. I didn't look at it once we got back from Vegas, but I didn't really have to. That memory was burned into my brain.
Speaker A: All right, well, let's. You definitely outpaced all expectations for, for your diet, but the. Let's move. Let's move to what else happened during the in between time, and that was some practice. Practice we committed to.
Speaker B: That's right.
Speaker A: So you wedged. I don't know how much you want to talk about your wedging.
Speaker B: I took, I took your advice. I mean, really, that's really what it came down to. I went to the range, and I did not even allow myself to get my bag out of my trunk. I pulled my wedge out, and I got a bucket of balls, about 50 balls. And I did nothing but hit wedges over and over and over and over. And I gotta tell you, I still have a ton to work through with my swing, but just, just doing that a couple times, it's amazing how quickly the wedge starts to feel really comfortable.
Speaker A: And then you did some, you did some shipping, too. I did. Because that's what I, that's what I really attacked in honesty hour.
Speaker B: I did, I went, I did some chipping, mostly in the, probably inside of ten yards, 15 yards to the green. Wasn't as pleased with the results on the chipping. If I, if I have to be honest, I've completely lost the ability to get a ball to bite. And I don't understand. I don't understand why, um, even after my recommitment to prove. But I did spend a lot of time chipping, and I also also putted with the grip adjustment you gave me in Vegas. And I gotta tell you, that's the wedge and the putter grip adjustment have been. Those have been massive for me, over the last month, I saw just immediate improvement on those.
Speaker A: I like it.
Speaker B: But you, you know, during the three week period, you also took to heart what I've been telling you about your driver.
Speaker A: I did. It only took eight months, but, yeah, I went out and there were actually three whole driving range sessions where that's all I did was. Was driver. I think. I think you said in Vegas, I need to hit a million drivers. I didn't quite get to a million drivers in three weeks, but I hit a lot of drivers. And I called you right after some of those sessions, and we've got that audio to play.
Speaker B: I want to hear about your range session.
Speaker A: Okay, let me cover my range session really fast. So, 42 drivers. Gosh, that makes me happy. And I logged the result of every one of them.
Speaker B: Oh, I want to hear this.
Speaker A: Do you want me to use me to run through?
Speaker B: Go straight through them.
Speaker A: Okay, first shot. Right ob, left, right obie. Left, right, right. At the target with a small cut ob. Left, right ob. Left rope hook. Rope hook, rope hook. Left, left. Weak slice. Left rope hook, pull, hook, pull, pull hook. Target with a small cut, left ob. Target with a small cut, left, left pull, hook. Rope hook. Pop up. Left, left. Duck hook.
Speaker B: This is easily the best thing we've ever done.
Speaker A: That's 30. That's. I've made it through 30 of them. And after 30, you probably heard in there. So of 30, I hit. Probably. So, let's see, 12344 out of 30 were near the target. And most of those where I say, yeah, most of those were out of play. So that was a few days ago. And then today I got another chance to get to the range, and I did the same thing. Target with a small cut. Target with a small cut. Target with a medium cut. Rope hook.
Speaker B: Rope hook.
Speaker A: Banana slice. Pull, pull, pull, slight pull, slight pull, pull, slight pull, slight pull.
Speaker B: Rope hook, duck hook.
Speaker A: And so I backed off. That was. So that's through 17 shots. So I backed off. More targets in there than last time, but still a lot of out of play balls. And I actually was at the. I was at the range where I get lessons, and my pro was out there. It was demo day. He was down at the ping ping tent, and he was. And he was actually hitting. And so I backed off, and I just. I watched him swing one time, and this. This guy has just the most effortless swing ever. And I just saw the ball take off, and I was like, okay, I'm going back, going back hitting. I'm gonna hit 30 more drivers, and there's not gonna be any tension in my swing. And as soon as I did that, I hit twelve straight that were at the target or just slightly pulled.
Speaker B: Oh, wow.
Speaker A: Nice. Like I was in a. I was in a rhythm with a driver that I have never seen. Yeah. If I can. If I can take that onto the. Onto the course in May, I'm gonna feel really good about my chances. Yeah.
Speaker B: The description of the hooks still makes me.
Speaker A: That is.
Speaker B: That might be the greatest piece of audio on the planet. I've never heard a hook described in more ways than you described it. But I have to give you kudos, though.
Speaker A: This.
Speaker B: This was such a good idea. I never even thought to sit and actually record every one of my swings, but this was such a good idea. I am going to commit to doing this. Not every range session, but definitely a lot more range sessions over the next several months because there was no debating. I think sometimes we can trick ourselves into how we. We hit the ball at the range. You know, when you, you know, you know how it goes, you kind of just. The first couple, you're just kind of hitting, you're not aiming, and then when you're working through something, you're not really aiming, and then, you know, you start to aim and it's like, well, that was like, you were detailed about the spots you were trying to hit. And there's no debating how your range session went, or there's no guesswork as to where your misses were. I mean, your misses were clearly predominantly left.
Speaker A: That's right.
Speaker B: So you had really good feedback there. I thought that was an awesome idea.
Speaker A: Yeah. I'll just say one other thing. I think the. The other advantage to doing that is it just takes us. Just took me a second to write down an evernote, you know, duck, hook, rock, pull, whatever. But that also helped my tempo.
Speaker B: Cadence? Yeah, your tempo at the range?
Speaker A: Just. Just my tempo at the range. I didn't. You can't rush through all your ball now. It's gonna take a while. But it made me back off, write the thing down, and then re aim and reset up like I would normally do. So, yeah, I kind of like that. I'm gonna think I'm gonna keep. Keep doing that. But it's funny. You bring up the. All the hooks. I was. I played part of that audio for Bethany and she said, now, what's the difference between a rope hook and a duck, duck hook and a snap hook?
Speaker B: And you were like, how do you not know this?
Speaker A: I said, a duck hook is when I'm really mad. A snap hook is when I'm kind of mad. And a rope hook is when I want to quit.
Speaker B: And a rope hook is what Eli used to kill someone on the 17th.
Speaker A: Hole at the Elanti.
Speaker B: At the Elanti.
Speaker A: That's a frozen rope hook. Sorry.
Speaker B: There's a frozen rope hook.
Speaker A: All right. And then the other thing. So we had some more stuff happen in these three weeks. We got out to play a little bit.
Speaker B: That's right.
Speaker A: So we are going to detail two of those rounds in particular. Let's start with Eli's. Here you are in the car before the round.
Speaker B: Okay. April 22. The focus today, coming off my range session, is shorter backswing and holding. My posture. That's pretty much. That's pretty much where my head's at today. And I want to make sure on my putts that I. That I accelerate through the ball. I do not want any. Any deseled putts I can live with. I can live with the misses as long as I'm hitting them aggressively and hitting through the ball. So, other than that, my goal today is. Is ten greens and regulation. That's what I'm aiming for.
Speaker A: So now, normally during a round, we're texting, we're following each other on live scoring apps, but we've stopped all that now. We go completely dark. We wait until we're able to record in order to up the drama in a new segment we're calling the dramatic reading of the scorecard.
Speaker B: Let me give you a dramatic reading of the scorecard.
Speaker A: Oh, let's go.
Speaker B: Okay, hold on here. Here we go. Hole one, par, par, bogey, par, birdie, par.
Speaker A: I'm sorry. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, whoa. Stop right there. Okay, so you're even. One, two, three. You're even after seven.
Speaker B: Seven.
Speaker A: Okay, keep going. Okay.
Speaker B: Hole eight, bogey, hole nine, double.
Speaker A: Okay, so you've. So that's a 39.
Speaker B: 39. Hole nine was a complete gag, by the way. It was. I absolutely nailed a drive. I had 75 yards into the green and just completely choked right into the sand trap. So, all in all, though, really good. Nine.
Speaker A: Okay, and you're hitting the ball well on these nine. On. On this nine, I'm hitting the ball great.
Speaker B: I'm hitting greens in regulation, and most importantly, I am putting really well. Your decel tip was absolute fire today.
Speaker A: Putter.
Speaker B: The putter was really, really good. The grip adjustment was great. But I, you know, as I mentioned on my voice note, my main focus was on not decelerating into the putts. So all in all, I was really pleased. Other than just a crappy 9th hole, other than a crappy 9th hole, it was really a good front. All right, moving to the back hole. Ten par, par, bogey, birdie, double birdie.
Speaker A: Wow.
Speaker B: Bogey, bogey, par. So I went 39. 39.
Speaker A: Whoo.
Speaker B: With a. With a cute little 78.
Speaker A: A cute little 78. And did I count three birdies?
Speaker B: Three birdies. All in all, I was. I was. The putter was hot. You know, I actually. So I had 28 putts, which was. That's a really good number for me. I mean, that's a really good number.
Speaker A: Have you ever had 28 putts?
Speaker B: I think 20 seven's my record, but it doesn't come very often. But I had 28 putts, and there weren't really. Honestly, there weren't really any, like, just stupid. You know, you're 50ft away, and you. It was mostly just. It was. It was everything in that five to ten foot range that can make or break a score was just going down. Now, I didn't hit as many greens as I wanted. I wanted to hit ten greens, and that's kind of been your guys magic number to get into the seventies. I hit eight greens, but I was 100% greens hit when I was in the fairway on my drives, which. The point of that being the work at the range with the wedge, it meant when I didn't kill myself off the tee, I was actually getting on the green. So I viewed that as a lot of positive reinforcement for what I was doing on the range by just hitting wedges.
Speaker A: Wow.
Speaker B: So confidence level from one to ten, probably an eight after that round.
Speaker A: Wow. This might tighten up the handicap race a little bit.
Speaker B: It did, and my handicap actually came down a good bit. It came down almost a point because of this. As far as my. My tracking.
Speaker A: Yeah. Wow.
Speaker B: So this was a big round.
Speaker A: A few days later, I had a dramatic scorecard to tell Eli about. Okay.
Speaker B: I have ignored my wife and my children because I need to hear how this round went. I threw everything at you to try to entice you earlier today into telling me what your score was and you would not do it.
Speaker A: You. You tried to break rules, and I really wanted to tell you, but I was able to. I was able to fight through it.
Speaker B: Well, I'm ready. Can we cue the dramatic music?
Speaker A: Let's go. The dramatic reading of the scorecard. This is river ridge golf course. Two day hole one bogey, par, par, par, par, par, par, par.
Speaker B: Gracious one over after six.
Speaker A: One over after six. Four of those. Four. Four of those pars without a green in regulation.
Speaker B: What?
Speaker A: So I'm scrambling, scrambling my tail off.
Speaker B: Okay, so I'm assuming driver is schizophrenic.
Speaker A: It's a little schizophrenic. It's a little bit. It's not. It's not terrible. Yeah. And I should have. I should have. I should have said that. Just for the record, I'm hitting driver.
Speaker B: As much as possible and staying with it.
Speaker A: Staying with it. That's right. Not. Not obeying the driver. Okay, so one over through six, 7th hole, double. Bad driver there. Bad driver. Okay, 8th hole, par. 9th hole, par. So go out in 39.
Speaker B: 39. Okay, three. So three over.
Speaker A: Okay, three over.
Speaker B: Okay, so driver is schizophrenic. Is this the standard? Like, everything you hit inside of 50 yards was just all over the stick or, like, how were you scrambling?
Speaker A: My driver wasn't. It wasn't going out of play up. And I had some just really good up and downs that I would normally not make. And then I also got some breaks, like on hole number eight, I hit one that should have been out of bounds, and it was like a yard in bounds. Okay. Actually, on hole number five, I got. I was. I was a yard from going in the water, so I got some. Wasn't hitting gray, but I got some breaks.
Speaker B: Okay, gotcha.
Speaker A: So three over on the front 10th hole, par, 11th. Par. Par. Par. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Speaker B: Wait a minute. What do you. Is that the 13th hole you just read 13th hole?
Speaker A: Yep.
Speaker B: You're three over after 13.
Speaker A: Three over after 1314. Bogey, par, birdie on 16. What? Wait a minute. Three over.
Speaker B: So that puts you at three.
Speaker A: Yes.
Speaker B: And you may re over going into 17 again.
Speaker A: You may recall, I think I was four over last time, but you may recall this happened. This happened about five months ago to the. Almost to the day. Five or six months ago. I can't remember which one, but my phone was dying out there on the course, unfortunately, so I was scared to take a whole bunch of audio. But when I got to 17, this is the par three that I tripled last time when I was. I was. Yeah. So it's four over going in 17. I end up shooting 80.
Speaker B: Right.
Speaker A: So I'm waiting on the tee because we got a. I got a twosome in front of me. And are you thinking about. Oh, yeah, I recorded this right here. Okay. I just birdied 16. I'm on River Ridge, the exact. And I'm in the exact same position. Position I was six months ago. I'm on 17, and I've got an eight iron and I'm three over. And that, and that didn't really. Didn't really cover everything that was going through my brain. In fact, we might have just a mini segment here called demons. All the demonic thoughts flowed into my brain here.
Speaker B: I like this. Why don't you get them out right now?
Speaker A: All my 17th hole failures just swept right in. Okay. And if you remember, when I tripled 17, I hit it fat and it went in the water. Okay. On that other 17th hole, I topped it and hit it in and hit it in the water. And literally, my brain keeps going back and forth while I'm waiting, is saying, well, make sure you don't top it, but make sure you don't hit it fat. I was an ad for psychology today. I don't know if I've ever had to back off a shot, especially when I'm playing by myself. But I. My heart was pounding. I backed off the shot. The other thing about this 17th hole is it is ridiculous. So there's a water. There's water just to the right of the green. There's hazard all the way left. There's a giant bunker in the back, and the green is severely back to front. And if you. If you miss on the left side, it will roll down into the hazard like you have to hit. If you do not hit the green, there's nowhere to miss.
Speaker B: And they're sharks with freaking laser beams swimming around the water.
Speaker A: It's the worst hole ever. Yeah. But the good news is I'm coming off of 16, where I just hit a laser with the same club. I got eight iron. So it's about holes. 160. It's a little downhill. Got eight iron. And make, make good contact. It hits the left side, but it's a little pulled. It hits the left side of the green and rolls all the way down. And it looks like it's going in the hazard, and it stops right on the edge.
Speaker B: A little gift from the gods.
Speaker A: Yes.
Speaker B: So you've got. So you got to get up and down.
Speaker A: Now I've got to get up and down, which I did not do. It was a pretty tough pitch. I think I had a ten footer and missed it, but. So I bogeyed. So that takes me. So you're four over going into 18.
Speaker B: What's your lowest round, by the way? Ever?
Speaker A: 75.
Speaker B: And how long ago was that?
Speaker A: College.
Speaker B: Holy cow.
Speaker A: Okay, so 18. I'm also feeling. Feeling the nerves and I hit a choke. This is, this is another break. I hit a choke. Choke driver block cut. Looks like it's going in the woods. It ends up in a pile of cut down trees, which is marked as ground under repair. And I'm able to drop out of it. Oh, so I'm not. It's a, this is a long par five. I'm not going for it in two, but I'm able to get it back in play. I've got a wedge in. I hit a great wedge. And I've got a twelve footer up the hill for birdie. And 75.
Speaker B: So you're in with a 76, though? Worst case scenario?
Speaker A: Worst case. Because there's, it's, it's an uphill putt. I'm.
Speaker B: No way you're three putting it.
Speaker A: Probably not. I mean, this is me. I'm sure I could figure out a way, but. Yeah, so I'm trying to make the putt. I actually was, was proud of the stroke. It was, it was a little nervy. I had the, I had the shakes going, but the, but it was aggressive. Just, it broke a little bit more than I thought, but. Easy tap in 76.
Speaker B: Are you freaking kidding me?
Speaker A: Not kidding you. Holy cow. Yeah.
Speaker B: That's four off, my friend.
Speaker A: Yes. And after your 78, serious number, I felt like I needed to do this.
Speaker B: I appreciate you just completely shooting in the, in the face my nice score and all the positive feel good momentum I had. Now I feel like the worst golfer on the planet.
Speaker A: There goes. You're completely inadequate, 76. But let me.
Speaker B: I've talked about.
Speaker A: Well, hold on.
Speaker B: You not talked about this, though. 76. 76 can feel a little bit like it. Like a 79. 75. 75 feels more like a 72.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker B: And you, you are teetering on that, that holy grail range.
Speaker A: Well, but let me just, let me just. Caution. Let me just be objective and honest, okay? I marked on my scorecard after the round 123-4567 holes where I could have easily bogeyed or worse that I didn't. And it was, it was either a, like, there was one shot on three, I was in complete jail and just very luckily got up and down. Then there was, there was a couple holes where I should have been in the water. There was the, there was the 14th hole where I was in the water and ended up, ended up making a very long 25 footer for par. And then on 18, I could have been 18, could have been a triple 18. Could have been a re t if it weren't for that ground under repair. So I'm this was the, this was the round. You know, there's some of those rounds were like, like the set like that. 70, a couple of those 79s or eighties. A few months ago, I might have said that was the highest I would have. I could have shot. 76 was the lowest. Well, I guess 75 was probably the lowest I could have shot, but it felt like ball striking wise. I got lucky. And finally, the last thing we're going to talk about today is two days before our trip to Myrtle. I got a lesson. And this lesson, we're not going to break down all the swing minutiae, but my pro said some fateful words to me that I had to tell Eli about later that night. All right, so there's one more thing I need to tell you about this lesson, okay? And I'm not going to. I've had some internal debate on whether I even mention this because I'm questioning my own maturity level to handle this.
Speaker B: I'm already terrified.
Speaker A: So my pro actually gave me advice to watch myself on video.
Speaker B: What?
Speaker A: Yeah, we're trying to get this one move down. And he took a video of my swing. He showed it to me and he said, you know, this one's hard to feel, so you should watch it on video. And I slowly turned to him and I said, what did you say?
Speaker B: Let me stop you right there. So what you're saying is on the eve of a golf trip, you have been given the green light to video yourself swinging the.
Speaker A: Obviously, he has not heard the podcast.
Speaker B: The one. I don't think I heard you. I just. I was signing back into my eco to my e coach account. I coach his eye account. I was just renewing my annual membership. I couldn't hear the last part.
Speaker A: What?
Speaker B: What were you saying? I just. I was putting my Amazon order in for a cell phone tripod.
Speaker A: I told him, I said, this is my, the one thing I've sworn off, and you have just introduced it back into my life. What are you doing?
Speaker B: Your accountability partner just took the software off the computer and said, I trust you. I think you can go ahead and surf the web freely. Now, hold on. Here's the problem. The problem is, as the two people who have more potential to obsess over watching their own swings than anyone else on the planet, we're going to do a golf trip with, what, 25, 26 people. I would put money down that you and I have just officially wrapped up our free time off the course as sitting down, hunkered down on our own, completely isolated, staring at iPad video.
Speaker A: We cannot do that.
Speaker B: No, we can't. But I'm terrified that's what's gonna happen.
Speaker A: No, no. This is why I was scared to bring this up. We gotta ease in.
Speaker B: Resist temptation. That's right.
Speaker A: Responsible. We're going to video a little bit. We're gonna dip our toe in just for a second, just see how it feels, and then just ease it in.
Speaker B: Just easing the tension, baby.
Speaker A: Ease in the tension. That's. That's where we live. He's in the tension. A lesson two days before a golf trip and professional clearance to watch a video. What could possibly go wrong? We'll cover that next time on chasing scratch. Thanks for listening today. If you like this podcast, we'd love it if you left us a review on iTunes that would really help us out. We were mixed today, as always, by Lenny Stirner, directed by KF Rager. We were produced by Fred F. Haynes, and Flatside wisdom was provided by Trip Chan. The master music credits are in the show notes. Our next episode will be after Labor Day. It will be our final catch up episode. We'll tell the story of myrtle and everything that happened after that to get you completely up to date. We'll talk to you then.
