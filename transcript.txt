Speaker A: Previously on Chasing Scratch.
Speaker B: Continue on I 15 south for one and a half miles.
Speaker C: We are driving in Las Vegas right now. Viva la viva. I just wanted to get. I wanted to get Eli's thoughts. Right now. He's headed into round two. He's down nine. Down nine. So. All right, we just got done with round two, and Eli put on a show. 78.
Speaker A: We are two guys in our mid thirties. We have wives, kids, jobs, adult responsibilities, and shaky eleven handicaps.
Speaker C: And we're trying to get those handicaps.
Speaker A: To scratch in a year. This is chasing scratch, episode five, Vegas, part two. All right, welcome back, everybody. This is Mike.
Speaker D: And this is Eli.
Speaker A: And today we are going to finish up Vegas. And this week we're actually playing catch up. We are going to have two episodes this week. So one's dropping today, and one will drop later this week, either Friday or over the weekend.
Speaker D: And that episode will cover the three week time period after Vegas, but before Mike and I go on another golf trip to Myrtle beach.
Speaker A: But before we get into that, we're going to finish up Vegas right now. So let's get into it. We left you last episode after round two of our four round cumulative stroke play match in Vegas, which we deemed the year's first major. And it was a tight match. Here's us driving to round three.
Speaker C: All right, it is 615 on day three, and we're driving back to bears best. And I, Mike, am clinging to a one shot lead after a nine shot lead was all but erased by Eli's 78 yesterday. Eli, how are you feeling this morning? Not as optimistic as I was yesterday, surprisingly. Really? Yeah. Because I think I'm. I think I'm emotionally cautious today, especially on the third day, on the third round, where we have probably slept a combined 12 hours and four days. And I gotta think at some point, just fatigue starts to come in. So that's what I'm thinking.
Speaker A: There's not too much to say, honestly, about round three, other than, like, previous golf trips. Our swings began to deteriorate and mine fell apart first.
Speaker C: Just an update. Hole three. I hate golf. All right, what are we on? Hole six? Five. Whatever it is, I'm ready to quit. I just actually executed a full sosa with an eight iron. That's how bad my swing feels. Oh, but don't worry. I hit it into a bunch of rocks. I'm holding back so many words right now.
Speaker D: My round actually started on a very positive note. I opened up with a great drive down the middle on the first hole and was on the green in regulation. However, the putting gods decided to strike my new putter with a curse, and I opened up the round on a three putt roll.
Speaker C: Two fairways, two gurrs, six putts, two boats.
Speaker D: After three putting the first three holes, I wasted no time in walking to the mound and signaling for a reliever.
Speaker C: That's the sound of the COVID going on the new putter. So, just to document, Eli has been playing with a new Cleveland putter. He now has three putts on each of his first three holes. And does this mean you're going to the prophecy? It's time. It's the type of shock. It's the type of shock treatment that my game needs right now.
Speaker A: In the green, the move worked great at first.
Speaker C: Massive lag tuput. I'm never gonna betray her again. The prophecy just lagged from 90ft to prophecy's back.
Speaker A: But a few holes later, the experiment was over.
Speaker C: Okay, the prophecy has. The honeymoon period with the prophecy is back in the back now. Over. Back in the back. I have a suggestion, though. The prophecy looks really good on lag putts. Do you bring out two putters? Green? That's a head chase movement. I think you need to do it. I'm in putt with the prophecy for the lag, and then anything inside of 5ft, you use the Cleveland, I'm not married to anything putter. I think it's a good move.
Speaker A: I think you should try it. Eli actually did try it and then abandoned it a few holes later. All in all, the round was pretty miserable. We actually stopped recording on the course after the turn, and we didn't turn the mic back on until we got back in the car to leave the course.
Speaker C: If you just pick one word. Let's pick one word. Do the one word game or one word on overall feel like one word on today's round? Violated. I feel like this course violated. Me. Violated. Okay. Neither of us could keep the ball in play, which, as we've talked about, means you're hitting into rocks out here in the desert with desert slashers at.
Speaker A: The end of round three. It was a 91 for me, a 92 for Eli. The kind of scores that make you embarrassed to have a podcast with the word scratch in it. But instead of objectively scrutinizing our poor play, we did the healthy, mature thing. We made fun of the guy we were paired with.
Speaker C: I do want to point out that the guy we played with, his name was Carl, Kip or Mel. Don't even remember. Good to see you, Carl. I forgot his name immediately, and just called him man. The rest of the. His name was big guy. Big guy. Shot big guy. I do want to just say that he made the statement. I almost. I almost stopped and wrote it down. I almost put it in evernote. We're on 15th hole, and we were on the green. He was about to putt for, like, a triple, and he said, man, I had a great back nine going until these last four holes. I was gonna say the same thing to you. I was like, so you had two good holes? 1011. I thought the same thing. I was like. I started to do the math, and I was like, maybe I'm not remembering right. That makes me feel like you had two good holes on the back. Oh, it was fantastic.
Speaker A: This went on for a while. If you're listening, Kip or Mel or big guy or whatever your name was, we apologize. We actually enjoyed playing with you. We just didn't want to talk about our terrible rounds.
Speaker D: We went back to the hotel room that night. I pulled out my iPad and began to look through old slow mo swing footage that we had recorded on the range, just trying to find an answer that might explain our poor play that day.
Speaker A: But in the middle of this, Eli was introduced to the real meaning of honesty hour. All right, we are. We are. We are needing to have an emergency recording session because something just happened in the hotel room here, and a divorce.
Speaker D: The beginnings of a divorce.
Speaker A: We need you to repeat what you just said. Let me set the stage real fast. We were. We were just analyzing some driving range footage, and there's a still of Eli at the top of his backswing. And, Christina, why don't you just say what you said about your husband, who you love?
Speaker B: Oh, wow. Oh, I'm not finished yet. Oh, wow. Look at your. Look at that angle of your stomach.
Speaker D: Okay, first of all, that wasn't what you said. You went, that's not a good angle. And there was no laughing about it. And then you said, let's all just say it. We all know you're big right now.
Speaker B: I didn't. No, no, listen. It's all out of love.
Speaker C: That is what you said.
Speaker A: That is what you said, christina.
Speaker B: Well, it's all out of love, because I love you, and I care about your health. That's why I said it.
Speaker D: You're worthless and weak. I love you.
Speaker C: I'm looking at.
Speaker A: I mean, we've got the picture up right now, and we're looking at it, and this. I mean, it is a special. It's a special view, special angle. Is there any. Is there any air in there, or is that all gut?
Speaker D: I was exhaling.
Speaker B: He was waiting to exhale. Seriously, though, you got to do something about that, boo.
Speaker D: Well, what do you want me to do?
Speaker B: Well, for starters, you could cut out the 16 cokes. You have a day.
Speaker A: Well, so we just got back from dinner, and just before we started looking at this picture, Eli had a snickers and a rice Krispies treat and a 20 ounce cup fat free, sugar free. It's 1130.
Speaker B: And there's oreos.
Speaker A: Vegas, right?
Speaker D: Those are good. Those are good calories.
Speaker B: Mm hmm. Good tasting calories.
Speaker A: Is that what's.
Speaker D: Is that what's holding me back? Is this the type of. Is this an honesty moment? Is this the type of tough talk that I need to go get in shape?
Speaker B: I think so. You need to just drink a whole bunch of water.
Speaker D: Just all water?
Speaker B: Yeah, just all water. I'll do it if you do it. That sounds like your accountability sounds like.
Speaker D: The worst idea on the planet.
Speaker B: I think it'll make a difference.
Speaker A: I don't think it's gonna help. I'm looking at this picture right now.
Speaker B: See, it's not just, can I post this on facebook?
Speaker D: No.
Speaker B: Can I make it my profile?
Speaker D: My mother.
Speaker C: My mother.
Speaker D: My mother already took that job four vacations ago, and she put a bunch of pictures of me up without a shirt on.
Speaker A: How much? How much? So, seriously, how much do you need to lose? Like, how much are you, like, overweight?
Speaker C: Like.
Speaker A: Cause Christina just said, let's be honest, you're overweight. Everybody knows it, so.
Speaker D: Well, let's put. But how much are you put this way? I played, my playing weight in college was 183, and you can add 40 pounds to that. And we're not quite there.
Speaker C: But it's good.
Speaker D: It's good weight. Strong weight.
Speaker B: It's strong. That's for sure. It's muscle, right? It's muscle.
Speaker C: All muscle, muscles.
Speaker D: Heavier muscles. Heavier than fat. I mean, you have to factor that in.
Speaker C: You do.
Speaker D: This is the type of tough talk I need, though. I mean, from the woman who said, till death do us part, when she looks at a picture and says, let's just say what everybody else knows, you're.
Speaker B: Big right now, listen, it's all out of love. I care about your health, and I need a father to stay around for my kids. So.
Speaker A: After that boost to Eli's confidence, we went to bed and got up really early for our 06:45 a.m. Tee time at Stallion Mountain.
Speaker B: In 1000ft, turn right onto entrance road to Stallion Mountain sea glow.
Speaker C: Stallion Mountain. Okay, we got you. Good. It's a neighborhood that means not tight means, yeah. We're driving into what looks like day one, which was 15 yard wide fairways, and then rocks on either side. Yippers. So I look at the horse there. Whoo. Oh. Oh, it's. And it's gated. That is a stallion. Italian stallion. Hey, golf. Awesome. Straight all we do, but thanks. That dude was excited. We were playing golf.
Speaker D: Security is tight around here.
Speaker C: You just go up and say golf, and they say, awesome.
Speaker D: What are you here to do?
Speaker C: Rob the residents. Awesome. Half a mile off. You need to check my id? No. Nope, go ahead. Wait a minute. Now, this looks different. Wait a minute.
Speaker A: Stallion Mountain was indeed different. And right away at the backdrop, we saw a man we could only hope would be our plane partner for the day.
Speaker C: We underrated Carl Withers. Carl Withers has been chubs. Well, first of all, you mispronounced his name as weathers. Or weathers. I mean, he's been Chubbs Apollo. He's been himself only poor and a degenerate actor on arrested development. Who loves Stu on arrested development. You get that together, baby. You got a stew going. He's been. He's been Apollo. He was that guy in predator that.
Speaker A: Got his arm knocked off.
Speaker D: Wasn't even Rambo.
Speaker C: It was a predator or rainbow. I think it was Rambo. Okay, that's amazing.
Speaker A: That is amazing.
Speaker C: By the way, I just put. Turn on the recorder because we just saw. We are in the. We were in the presence of acting royalty. We just saw Carl Weathers.
Speaker D: That guy's dead on.
Speaker C: Dead on car. Weathers.
Speaker D: Ease the tension, baby.
Speaker A: All right?
Speaker C: And we have made a pact that if we are paired with him, one of us has to go up behind him and say, it's all in the hips. Just ease of attention. These intentions gonna be a special day.
Speaker A: Our warm up was cut short by a stallion mountain employee telling us we could get off early. Did we mention we liked this courgette?
Speaker D: Stallion Mountain plus one.
Speaker C: We just found out that there's some bad news. We are not playing with chubbs. But we did just find out that we are playing alone. No. Pair up for the final round. This could be fantastic. We're headed to the first tee. Stallion Mountain is my favorite golf course ever in the entire world. Birdie. Whoo. Mike birdies out of the gate with a.
Speaker D: Not just a birdie, I might add a.
Speaker C: A walk it to the whole birdie. As soon as it came off the putter, head felt good. Not gonna lie it's a. It's a three shot lead right now. Oh, this course is a different world. All right. We're playing Stag Mountain every time next year.
Speaker A: I was feeling great after an opening birdie, but then after the second hole.
Speaker C: We'Re back to even for the day after hitting a green regulation. I four putt it. In your defense, though, I don't think these greens are rolling anything like. I don't mean that in a bad way. I mean, they're great. They're just not rolling like the two courses we played. I four putt it. That's the key. And then you gave one of the greatest. One of the greatest responses you've ever given me, which was what? I said, hey, just think it like this. You birdied one. You birdied one, and then that's.
Speaker D: You basically made that a bogey, and.
Speaker C: Just, without a care, you went, yeah, whatever. It was the worst way to make me feel better ever.
Speaker A: Hey, hey, hey.
Speaker C: It's gonna be okay. It's just like you par the first and bogey the second. No, it's not like that at all. I four putt it.
Speaker D: All right.
Speaker C: After we're on the fourth hole, we have determined this course is completely different. I'd come back to Vegas just for the course. As of this point, it could get worse, but we have an openness. It's not. It's not like the. It's just wide open, but there's trees, there's houses, there's actual rough. Like, if you hit it, it's not just fairway and then rocks. Yeah. So, stallion Mountain, right now, you're on fire.
Speaker A: Through nine holes, I had a 41, and Eli had a 43. But ball striking wise, for the fourth day of a golf trip, we were both very pleased. I was actually hitting driver and hitting.
Speaker D: It pretty well, and my experiment with the shortened backswing was paying off. I hit driver really well in the front but hadn't managed to hit approach shots that were giving me the opportunity to score.
Speaker A: As we went to ten, Eli needed to make up some ground.
Speaker C: Just finished ten. Two pars. Mike with a. That was a painful par. This hole had had a tough fairway to hit. It bent it had a road on the right. I hit it the best drive of my life. Mike missed the fairway, missed the green, ran a chip along, and then hit a 20 foot putt and hurt my feelings. You part two. Yeah, but I needed to pick up a stroke there. That one did not feel good.
Speaker A: My lead stayed at four for the next few holes, but on hole 13, Eli cut it to three. And then after a bomb drive on the short par five 14th, Eli had a shot to get on in two. While I was in trouble left. This was Eli's opportunity to close the gap. I made sure he knew about it as I narrated his shot.
Speaker C: Eli has driven this.
Speaker A: 302 yards. He's got 1192 the center.
Speaker C: He's got 1ft in the pressure cooker and the other in the frying pan. As a golfer, I know big shot here, probably biggest shot of his life, trying to answer back.
Speaker D: And just like that, the four round cumulative stroke play event was basically over. I managed to completely yank my second shot, not only left of the green, but left of the road beside the green. After somehow managing to land in a spot that wasn't out of bounds, I received a drop in a very nice area of grass, only to flop that approach shot and then eventually blade the next shot over the green. As I walked off the 14th hole with a double bogey, the competition between Mike and I was all but over.
Speaker A: After I parred, the lead was up to five, and Eli decided to blame his 56 degree wedge recorders.
Speaker C: Gotta come on at this moment because we just had the first wedge throw, followed by the wedge slam into the rocks. I'm just trying not to say words that I don't need to say.
Speaker A: I parred the next two, and that increased my lead to six. And while the competition was pretty much over, Eli had one last desperate attempt to sabotage my round.
Speaker C: All right, we're on 16 after par. Starting the 15th, my competitor decided to play a little game. He decided to say, that was not a game, I promise. He decided to say, hey, you're won over. You're won over on the back. I did not think of that. I was merely making the point. Your throat stomping me. I did not know I was one. Over on the back. I said I didn't know that. What did I do on the next t top it? I did not mean that as a head case comment. I meant it more as a commentary. The fact that I keep. There's no opportunity for me to get back in this. I know you didn't mean it, but the fact I had to document this anyway, because I can't deny that the awareness played into what I just. Oh, did it really well?
Speaker A: I had to.
Speaker C: I didn't even think. Honestly, I didn't even think about that when you hit the shot. Now that I'm thinking about it, I see where that would have happened. But I wasn't up there. I wasn't up. My swing thoughts were the same, but they're. You're aware that you're one over? One over.
Speaker A: I managed bogey on 16. I pard 17, which set up the 18th, a par for around in the seventies.
Speaker C: Mike comes the 18th with a speed like lead. He could basically. He could basically shift his way all the way down the fairway and win six points. Six strokes. Is that what you're up? Six stroke lead right now? All right, now with that aside, because I think our competition is pretty much toast, this is a good round for you. What are you at? Could be a good round. Six over seven. I don't know about that one was five over on the front. Oh, okay.
Speaker D: I had you to 40 on the front. Sorry.
Speaker C: Okay, so this would accomplish, this would accomplish a goal right here of staying in the seventies. You're killing me. I'm setting the stage. Just ease the tension, baby. When you were about to shoot 78, did I get on the recording and.
Speaker A: Start saying, oh, this is this drive.
Speaker C: With water on the right? I'm just sitting. It's for the pod. I'm trying to set the stage here, make sure our listeners have a good idea. I think this needs to come up here. Is it still on?
Speaker A: Yeah, it's still on the 18th with a dogleg right. Par five with water running the full length of the hole on the right side. I took driver and picked a conservative line away from the water.
Speaker C: Good ball, actually, you murdered that ball. Get down, get down. Went through.
Speaker D: Did it go through it?
Speaker C: Yeah. Nice. I went through on the other side. That's gonna be. No, I think you're fine there. Smart angle. Takes the water out of it. Oh, my gosh. I was nervous. So you almost flew to the trap in the air, right? I flew over the trap in the air. Over the trap in the air. So who knows what's on the other side, but hopefully I got an angle.
Speaker A: Unfortunately, I didn't have an angle. I had to pitch out and was unable to make parallel. I bogeyed and shot 80.
Speaker C: All right, Eli, birdies. I bogey, but you win. The only thing I gotta decide is what brand, what shirt or hat or whatever do you want? By the way, I want to interject.
Speaker A: A special thanks here to Brent and James from Sacramento. They were the first guys we played with. They're big Mitch Richmond fans. They gave us the idea that the winner of this trip should get a shirt from the last course we play, and we love this idea so much. We're going to implement this going forward. In the golf shop after the round, I selected a stallion mountain embroidered puma golf shirt just to needle Eli for his unwarranted dislike of Ricky Fowler. Soon we were back in the car, and I told Eli about a mental change I had made prior to round four.
Speaker C: The biggest difference. And I'm gonna. I'm actually gonna bring. I didn't say this before the round because I didn't want to speak it into existence, but remember when I went to the pool yesterday and I told you I was listening to that book? So the book that I'm actually. Before I say that, I just want to say, if you're coming to Las Vegas. Oh, my goodness. Go play Stallion Mountain. I can't say enough good things about Stallion Mountain. Yep. Great price point. Great price point. And the layout, again, is just such a refresher from everything else we've seen. But. But also there was a good mix of just straight holes. Yeah. But also you had to play cuts. Yeah. You know, they gave you the opportunity. I talked about this. They gave you the opportunity, the last five holes to play the course or two different ways. Yeah. Plus they had 620 tee times, 620 tee times, and a 495 breakfast. We just say. So we finished at 10:00 then we ate breakfast. Dynamite breakfast. Best breakfast we've had since we've been here. Yeah. Yeah. So, stallion Mountain, well done. Good job. All right, so back to what I was saying. Oh, yeah. I read the book. The book is called be a player. Be a player by Frick, Pia Nilsen and somebody.
Speaker A: Pia Nilsen and Lynn Marriott is what I was trying to say to give them full credit.
Speaker C: But I've read a couple books by them. One was every shot has. It has its purpose. That's the one with about think box and playbox that you read that one chapter. Yep. This one's called be a player. And what I was listening to yesterday was talking about the difference between your left brain and right brain. And your left brain is obviously what you're doing when you're trying to get real technical about your swing and everything like that. But your right brain, your creative side, is also your athletic side. And they said what we find is with, you know, they mentor a bunch of pros, they say, we find that when you get too technical, even if they're good swing thoughts that you're thinking about, you decrease your. You're the right. The part. The right part of your brain, the creative part. The creative, the athletic part of your brain goes away. And so they went again back to the think box, playbox you think, and then as soon as you get over the ball, you're not thinking, you're just reacting. So that was, that was actually what I did today because actually I went on the range. I actually did not have that good of a range session because I was trying to get real technical and then I said, screw it. I'm gonna, I'm gonna have a good tempo and I'm gonna do, I'm gonna do the weight shift, but I'm gonna swing with what I got. I'm gonna swing with whatever's in the memory bank. And that's so over most shots until you said I was one. Only one over part. Sabotage these sabotage my brain.
Speaker A: And then back in the hotel, it was time for honesty hour.
Speaker D: Okay, so you and I talked in the car about now that we've had four days of seeing our swing, seeing our games, it's time for honesty hour.
Speaker A: Honesty hour.
Speaker D: Sponsored by ping. Come on, ping.
Speaker A: Ping. Yes. Honesty hour.
Speaker D: My honesty hour. Point number one came, came on the 18th hole today. Yes. And I was thinking about it in the middle of the fairway the whole time you were thinking about your second shot and it didn't even dawn on me. It didn't even dawn on me until I was in the fairway. It was, it was like a lightning bolt went off. I was sitting there at 18 when I clicked the yardage to my second shot. I was like, man, any low handicapper would have come into this hole and they would have been like, go time, baby. Like, they would have been like, I am going. I am. I'm going to frickin have a run at eagle. And worst case, I'm walking out here with a par, but probably a birdie. And I thought it was just funny the approach that we've both had. My low round that was in the seventies, I wanted off the course immediately. Your low round with a shot at the seventies, you wanted off the course immediately. And it's just, it's funny to me because I'm like, even the last four holes, the way you were hitting your wedges today, you should have thrown a driver up there and been like, I'm going to have 80 yards in. And you're. All week you've had, you've been able to have the ball check so well and you've controlled your distances. You could have had a birdie. You could have had two birdies in the last four or five holes. And it. Your mentality, I think, has to change. You have got to go back and say, I'm going to master my driver. Not that I have to hit it a mile, but I've got to go put it because you should have annihilated those last five holes the way your wedge game was.
Speaker A: I will, I will agree with. So, yeah, I'll definitely agree with that point. And I think that's a big takeaway for me is, I mean, it's what we said back in August, I got to get better with driver. But my lack of confidence in driver brings into those, it just brings into like I'm going to guard against, I'm.
Speaker C: Going to guard against the big, the.
Speaker A: Big miss when I don't need it. So the last hole was par five. I didn't, not going to club down there. I'm going to hit driver. But those three, three preceding holes, I know I hit a good three, three iron and I got a full wedge in. But I totally hear your point because I would have much, rather, much rather been able to be aggressive, but it's just a matter of trusting that club.
Speaker D: I think you have to go back and hit your driver a million times over the next month before Myrtle to where it's like I'm gaining strokes here. I'm going to, if you're giving me an opportunity, I'm going to pick strokes up.
Speaker A: I'm going to accept that moment of honesty and I'm going to say, yes, I agree. I agree. That's, that's where I've got to get to is where I'm at least, I'm at least confident enough that I can keep that club in play. All right. I received that moment of honor.
Speaker C: We go.
Speaker A: You ready for mine?
Speaker D: I'm ready.
Speaker A: I think, I think your next lesson might need to be a short game lesson, not, and it, your putting stroke is not that, like, I don't see your putting as your main problem. I think it's you. I think you've got to get some, you've got to get some more shots around the green with, with wedges.
Speaker D: Are you okay? I completely receive that. Are you? So would you say more in the 20 yards and in type shots or more like the 80, the 60 to 80 yard shots?
Speaker A: I'd say all the above. But what I noticed specifically was there's spots where I saw you off the green and I honestly looked at him and I looked at you and I said, I don't think he's got that shot. No, like I, like I looked at and I said, he needs to play. He needs to play a flop here or he needs to play. He needs to. And I was like, I don't, I don't think he's got it.
Speaker D: No.
Speaker A: So.
Speaker D: And you made up. And by the way, that's what would keep you, like, on, on Wednesday when I was running and you weren't playing well.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker D: You managed to keep everything around the bogey range because you would be in a crappy position but could throw the ball onto the green in a way where it gave you a shot at salvaging a good score and you can putt well.
Speaker A: Right.
Speaker D: I don't have anything around the green.
Speaker A: Yeah. I would, I would say the, the stuff, the chip, the chips and the pitches, I'd say they might even be more important than the 80 or 60.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker A: Shots because I think that's the stuff where you've got to be able to save. Yeah, save.
Speaker D: I completely receive that.
Speaker C: But.
Speaker D: But it's hard for me. I guess the hard part is to go to a lesson. To go to a lesson and not. And not work on your swing. That's hard for me. But I have no confidence on the greens. I feel like I cannot. I'm just surviving on the green. That's all it is. And a lot of times I'm not even doing that. I mean, there were, there were a ton of times. There were a ton of times this weekend where I made good shots into the green and three putted because I just. I am so unconfident on the green, it's not even funny. So I received that. I'll make a commitment. I will. The next lesson, I will split in half.
Speaker A: Yeah, I like that.
Speaker D: And tell him I want to do a little bit of work on the swing and I want to do a little bit of work around the green because the other.
Speaker A: The thing about that's. I think that's a good thing because it's not going to take long. Like, what you need to do is get, get a technique from him that you feel good about.
Speaker D: And then I got to go hit a thousand balls.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker A: But you just need to find a practice green that'll let you chip. After making those commitments, me to focus on driver Eli to focus on short game Eli took a moment to be honest with himself.
Speaker D: You're going to laugh about this. I have got to get in shape. You saw, you witnessed last night firsthand the aggression at the post 10:00 hour that took place from a food perspective.
Speaker A: I did see the aggressiveness.
Speaker D: You witnessed the aggressiveness. A Mountain dew and a pack of oreos.
Speaker A: This was followed by the. The night before at 11:00 a 20 ounce coke, a rice Krispie treat, and.
Speaker D: A milky Way, hashtag nightcap, hashtag sleepwell.
Speaker A: And I'm not sure how much we've documented this in other conversations, but just so the listeners know, Eli has the worst diet of anyone I know, anyone that potentially exists.
Speaker D: Yeah, I should be dead outside of.
Speaker A: This 600 pound life.
Speaker D: I, about six years ago, I told Mike, I've got to get back in shape. I've got to get healthy. It's not going to happen unless I'm spooked to death. So I scheduled a full physical with blood tests. I went in, I had the blood work done. I had the physical done. They were going to call me with the results. Did I call you?
Speaker A: You were ready to be motivated.
Speaker D: I was scared. I was like, it's coming. Something bad's coming. I can feel it. They called me when I was at work and said, eli, this is the doctor's office. We have your blood test back. And I literally said, let me go into a private conference room because this will be the moment when I tell people this was the lowest point in my life. I got the news. I didn't know what to do. I went to a conference room. I said, okay, I'm ready. And the lady said, your blood work was immaculate. You're perfectly healthy. Actually, the doctor said, don't bother getting blood work done for three more years. And I called you and I told you that. I told them what you said.
Speaker A: Why did you tell me that?
Speaker D: I said, I won't be alive in three years. You just killed me.
Speaker A: You said you needed to tell me.
Speaker D: Tell me something bad. So, so anyway, I've got to get in shape. I have got to lose some weight.
Speaker A: Was this motiv? Is this motivated by the twist picture.
Speaker C: That you, that your wife, the one.
Speaker D: Where my wife, my wife so gently and kindly told me, look, let's just get it out there. You're bigger than. Everybody knows it. What was her line?
Speaker A: Everybody knows it.
Speaker D: Let's just, let's just say you're overweight. You're overweight. She really loves me, so that's got to be one of my, that's got to be worked its way in some way.
Speaker A: Okay. Okay. So now we got to talk about this. How do you propose to do this?
Speaker D: A 30 day yoga challenge?
Speaker A: No. How are you going to change your diet?
Speaker D: I don't care.
Speaker A: I've got it figured out.
Speaker D: I'm going to start smoking. It's going to curb my appetite, and I'm going to immediately lose weight.
Speaker A: John Daley did it.
Speaker D: Marlborough, Camel. We're waiting. You want to throw some sponsorship money our way? I'll start smoking. Just let me know.
Speaker A: So anyway, do you have any sort of plan? Do you want any sort of help? Actually, I don't even want to help, because every time I've tried to help, you don't listen, there's no.
Speaker D: I'm just gonna have to do it. And it's not a. I don't need a psycho plan, but I think you do need. I don't. Look, here's the deal.
Speaker A: Here's what you need to do.
Speaker D: If I did two things, my life would be completely different. Don't eat McDonald's every day for breakfast.
Speaker A: And don't drink soda.
Speaker D: And don't eat after dinner. It's not hard. Don't drink soda and don't drink soda.
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker D: There's three things. If I just did those things and they're not hard. It's not rocket science.
Speaker A: But that.
Speaker D: But that, I would drop 30 pounds.
Speaker A: That. That is a psycho plan, though.
Speaker D: Like, so, but I've done that. I've done that for two weeks. I've done that for three weeks. I've done that for a week and a half.
Speaker A: Done that for three days.
Speaker D: Do you remember, like, two years ago, I went, like, four weeks without a soda?
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker D: And I commented how great it felt.
Speaker C: Yep.
Speaker D: And then I just quit.
Speaker C: Well.
Speaker A: But here's what happens. So the last time. The last time that you went through a health spurt, probably the fourth one of this year, of this calendar year, I think it lasted seven days.
Speaker D: Good.
Speaker A: Seven days, though, on. And part of that was no soda.
Speaker D: That's just such a killer.
Speaker A: And then you were talking to me on the 7th day, and you said, if I had. If I. If I find this footage, I'll put it. I think it was on the podcast. He said. He said, oh, yeah, yeah, I'm good.
Speaker C: I'm good tonight.
Speaker A: I just had a coke. And I said, whoa, what?
Speaker D: I thought you.
Speaker A: I thought you were off coke. He's like, oh, it's Friday.
Speaker D: Cheat mail.
Speaker A: It's cheat day.
Speaker C: I've made it six days.
Speaker A: I deserve it.
Speaker D: Reward yourself. Hashtag Joel Osteen.
Speaker A: What I'm saying is. So I agree with those three points, but I'm saying you have to be psycho about those three points.
Speaker D: I do.
Speaker A: You can't. You can't. There's no reward. You have to cut off soda completely. Here's what can't even be an option.
Speaker D: Here's what I can't do. I can't have a long term goal because it's impossible. I can't. I can't look out that long. I think I could lock it. What day is the golf trip? What's the Wednesday when we will meet up and play the practice round?
Speaker A: May 3 is the Thursday.
Speaker D: It's like 25 days.
Speaker A: 25 days.
Speaker D: 25 days is what I need to lock in for. That's a short enough timeframe. I can't. I just can't. Like, the thought of doing something for a year. It's too impossible to think about.
Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, but.
Speaker C: So.
Speaker A: But you go psycho on those three.
Speaker D: Things for three weeks. Basically.
Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. You do those three things and it will make a significant difference. But why? Why do you need to get in shape?
Speaker D: Well, I think part of it is the fact that I'm wildly uncomfortable and my back hurts. Okay, but if you carried around 30 more pounds every day than you should, your back would hurt, right? So I did get worse. Like, not even. There have been little thoughts I've had.
Speaker C: Gotcha.
Speaker D: So that. I think that's. That would be the biggest. I just. I don't want. I woke up a couple mornings this week and actually, I felt really good once I got on the course. But there were a couple mornings where I was like, oh, man. And you would come out and I'd be like, I don't. Oh, man, I don't feel good today. And you were like, I don't feel that bad. And you slept like 3 hours. I was like, how do you not feel bad? Like, this makes no sense. I'm on a foreign bed. I woke up twelve times last night. My back hurts, my knees hurt. Like, what do you mean you don't feel bad? So something's gotta change. Cause I want to be. In the words of your father, I wanna be able to play this game a long time.
Speaker A: It's true. Leaving Vegas, we accomplished some goals, we failed at others. But at the end of the day, this is a quest all about chasing a number and lowering our handicap. We managed to do that after Vegas. Eli was down to a 10.4 and I was down to a 9.7. In the three weeks we had to prepare for our next golf trip, we'd have the chance to lower it some more. Okay, I just. Just birdied 16.
Speaker C: I'm on River Ridge and I'm in.
Speaker A: The exact same position I was.
Speaker C: Six months ago. I'm on 17 and I'm three over.
Speaker A: We'll talk about that next time on chasing scratch. Thanks for listening. If you like this podcast. We'd love it if you left us a review.
