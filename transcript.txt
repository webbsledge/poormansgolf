Speaker A: Previously on Chasing Scratch.
Speaker B: So I've determined I need professional help. I need someone that knows what they're doing, and I have to commit to them.
Speaker A: Where I get in trouble is just my vanity, and how I think my swing should look determines what I decide to work on or change in my swing.
Speaker C: Agreed.
Speaker A: Video is out. I'm done with video. I think I figured out golf. We are two guys in our mid thirties. We have wives, kids, jobs, adult responsibilities, and shaky eleven handicaps. And we're trying to get those handicaps to scratch in a year. This is chasing scratch. Episode three, the fall. All right, before we get started today, this is Mike.
Speaker B: And this is Eli. So we just got back from our first major of the year out west in Las Vegas, where we played four rounds of golf stroke play. There was a lot of good, there was a lot of bad. We're going to fill you in on all of that at a later date.
Speaker A: But today's episode is called the Fall because we're going to hit the highlights of the events of the fall of last year. Our first few months of our commitment to scratch. In case you forgot, our last episode detailed our plans to get to scratch. We laid out various ideas around practice, exercise, mental approaches, and any other thing we could think of that would help us achieve our goal. After that, though, we took two divergent paths. My path began with a round the very next day after we finalized our plans. And as I told you last episode, I went into the round without any scoring expectations. My goal was simply to hit driver every hole I could and begin to get a feel for the specific areas of my game that were in need of improvement. I managed to stick to that strategy until I finished the front nine at one over. And then what happened on ten would change everything. Walking off the 10th green, I just birdied. I'm even for the day. And, uh, yeah, I think I figured out golf. I was even par with eight to go. This was easily the best round I had played in the past ten years. As the 11th hole approached for the first time all day, I was thinking crazy thoughts. Scratch thoughts. I took out my driver. I picked my line with confidence, went through my pre shot routine, and stood over the ball. What in the world was that? The sound you just heard was a top. I topped a driver and watched it bounce pathetically about 20 yards before it disappeared into a hazard. I tried to shake it off, but unfortunately one mistake turned into another and I walked off the 11th with a triple bogey. And all of a sudden, the first head case thoughts started to creep into my mind. I actually didn't panic, though. I played the rest of the back nine fairly well, though I was no longer thinking I had figured out golf, and I went into the par five 18th at five over par. Still a fantastic round for me. I told Eli the rest of the story later that night. We get to 18, and I'm plus five.
Speaker B: And you're plus five going into 18.
Speaker A: Yes. Plus five going out 18. So it's par 72, so par for 77. And I'm not happy with what my mindset was because basically I got the 18 and I just wanted the hole to be over.
Speaker B: Right. And not an aggressive mindset.
Speaker A: Right.
Speaker B: What was. What was 18?
Speaker A: Par four, par five, big long par five. So I make great contact with the driver, but again, it's a little bit right. I'm in a get to get into a fairway bunker. Come out of the fairway bunker. Okay, I've got about 150 in some rough. I think I hit it perfect, but comes up short in a bunker. And then again, my mindset inside in the bunker was terrible. I was thinking of all the worst things I was adding up. The max I could make on this, the max I could make on break 80, and that was all I was doing. Yeah, that's not, that's not. No, I wasn't happy about that. So I hit the bunker, shot a little fat, but it gets out. I'm on the fringe. Two putt from there. 78. Wow. So, seven.
Speaker B: You shot six over the. The inaugural round.
Speaker A: Yes. So are you done?
Speaker B: Are we calling? Am I the only one left doing this now?
Speaker A: So I was happy. I had just hit driver. Well, all round, except for that one strange top, and I was in the seventies. And, Eli, I just want a quick round of honesty as we look back at this. When you heard I shot a 78, were you happy for me?
Speaker B: Not at all. So, honestly, I was partly happy, but it also created some massive insecurities with me because I thought, oh, my gosh, I don't think I shot in the seventies all of 2017. And if you just changed your mindset and threw some goals out and all of a sudden we're firing in the seventies. Now, I had a feeling that this chase was going to end very quickly and I was not going to be on the right side.
Speaker A: And your start went a little differently than my start.
Speaker B: Completely different. Unlike Mike, who actually started the quest on day one with a live round, I went the other route. I went and got a lesson with the hopes that I would begin to build good habits in my practice sessions. Unfortunately, the lesson ended up starting what would end up being a weeks long streak of being unable to hit the ball.
Speaker A: Here's a voice note Eli sent me after around one weekend.
Speaker C: All right, day seven and I am at. I am at the pit of despair.
Speaker A: There is.
Speaker C: I don't know there's ever been a lower point. I have no feel for anything. I walked off the course on the 18th hole from the middle of the fairway.
Speaker B: I said, I'm done.
Speaker C: The most frustrating part is I had a lesson. I had a lesson six days ago and my swing felt like butter. It was butter on a hot roll. I hit the ball great. I walk out of the lesson and I have no muscle memory at all. This pursuit, it could not feel more out of my reach than it does right now.
Speaker A: Naturally concerned, I tried to get ahold of him. Also, I wanted to compliment him on his usage of the phrase butter on a hot roll, which I had not heard since 1997.
Speaker C: Okay, it's day eight driving to work.
Speaker A: And Eli has gone off the grid. Tried to call him last night, I got nothing.
Speaker C: Just tried to call him again. So I don't know what to think. This might become a solo venture.
Speaker A: There he is.
Speaker C: I didn't hear the phone ring. Why did I not hear the phone ring, you might ask. Because you were doing yoga? Because I was out in the garage doing my workout.
Speaker A: Wow.
Speaker C: That's right. Well, did you do your yoga or did you just do a workout? No, I'm doing my yoga tonight. But anyway, so what's the deal? Are you quitting? Are you reading? Are you reading?
Speaker A: Don't jump.
Speaker C: I had to get to, I had to get back to a good place last night because I was not in one when I came home.
Speaker A: Eli went into more detail later that night. Okay, so hold on, hold on, hold on. You're you. Your voice note said you walked off the course. Did that really happen?
Speaker B: I'm not proud of it, but it happened. I just tell that tells you the level that it got to. And not only that, I walked off. You know, like we've all been on the course before when somebody in the group just lost it and left. But typically that happens in that eight to twelve hole range, right?
Speaker A: Or like when you're wet or when you're waiting on a really slow group and. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker B: But it's like, I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't want to keep doing this for another hour and a half.
Speaker A: Right?
Speaker B: I walked off from the middle of the fairway on the 18th hole. That tells you how fr. That tells you how frustrated I was. I just left, and everybody in the group was like, what are you doing? I was like, I'm out.
Speaker A: Were you playing with three other people?
Speaker B: Yeah. I was like, I'm out. I'm not finishing. I'm done.
Speaker A: Okay. They were like. They're like, so you're waiting to. You're waiting to hit your approach shot. Your ball is. You've hit your drive, and you just determine it's time to go unbuckle your cart, and you just walk.
Speaker B: Oh, I'm in the cart with somebody. We pull up to my ball, and I was like. I was sitting there just stewing. I was just furious. And finally, I was getting out to get my club, and I went, no, I think I'm done. I don't even want to hit. I don't even want to hit this shot. I don't want to miss the green and then have to chip on with a crappy chip and then three putt on the green. I'm done. I went. I literally, I got out of the cart, and I just went, I'm out. And the guy. The guy that was driving was like, what? He was like, what do you. What do you mean you're out? I was like, I'm going home. I'm done. He was like, you're on the 18th hole. I said, I know. I'm leaving. I'm done. I don't even want to finish this round.
Speaker A: Oh, my gosh. That's unprecedented.
Speaker B: It was not good.
Speaker A: All right. Now, while this is. While this is one of the greatest things I can. I can picture you doing, I do have to just bring something up. So we are in a competition here about low handicaps. Is this. Is this sort of behavior legal?
Speaker B: You know, so I actually thought about this. I know exactly where you're going. And this actually crossed my mind before I unhooked my bag. And my thought was, if this was. If this was in August, there's no way this type of behavior could fly. I mean, August of 2018.
Speaker A: Oh, yeah.
Speaker B: That could be, in all likelihood, one of the what? That would be one of the 20 most recent. That's the only justification I had for doing this.
Speaker A: Well, number one, number 114 months away.
Speaker B: Is that we're 14 months away, and I better have more than 20 rounds between this one and the finishing in October. But. But also just so. Just so I didn't snap my new irons and have to go get refitted, I thought that that was probably enough justification to just go ahead and go.
Speaker A: So this is actually great self awareness from you.
Speaker B: It was, it was, it's probably all that yoga I've been doing. It may, it gave me inner peace, full awareness.
Speaker A: Full body awareness.
Speaker B: That's right. Yeah. Can we, can we, what is the term for that? Can we just develop one right now?
Speaker A: A walk off a bonds. A bond.
Speaker B: Is that where they erase it from the record book?
Speaker A: Actually, that could be.
Speaker B: We'll call it the, we can put, we can call it the Palmaro. I can, I can point into a mic and say, I never played that round.
Speaker A: I like a palmeiro.
Speaker B: I like that. It's kind of like a, it's kind of like an Arnold Palmer, but instead of a mix of two drinks, you're vehemently denying that you had a bad.
Speaker A: Round of golf and you're quitting before it, you're quitting before the end.
Speaker B: Palmaroing did you Palmaro yeah, I did a full pal Marrow.
Speaker A: He got so mad that he.
Speaker B: Palmeiro and I think a half Palmaro would be like, when you're on a hole and you're like, I'm just picking up, you just put me down for the max. That's a half Palmeiro but I think you should be, I think you should be forced at that point to have to look at everyone in the group and say, I did not play.
Speaker A: You have to point at him.
Speaker B: Well, we've already, we've already established so single, which we've seen, as you mentioned, we saw Spieth do it. So that's a professional term now.
Speaker A: If so, basically our nicknamed criteria is you have to be a power baseball hitter in the mid nineties and indicted for steroids. You have to point at the person. That's so good. All right, well, you mentioned your feelings. I've come up with a come with a term. It does not have to do with nineties power hitters in baseball. It is the OFP and that is your overall feeling of possibility. Wow. So if you and the OFP goes from one to nine, because if you're ten, you're just lying. So your overall feeling of possibility that you will achieve scratch in what is now eleven months. No, no, sorry, 13 months.
Speaker B: So nine is like the most optimistic.
Speaker A: Nine being the most optimistic, one being how you felt driving home when you palm arrowed.
Speaker B: I'd say I'm at a two and a half.
Speaker A: Wow.
Speaker B: If I'm grading myself, honestly, this adjustment of my swing is, it is going to be very difficult. So I'm hoping I'm doing all the right things that will produce muscle memory. But I told you, mentally, I'm at.
Speaker A: A low point right now. Wow. Okay.
Speaker B: What about you?
Speaker A: Um, I think I'm at a six.
Speaker B: Well, you should be after your velvety 78.
Speaker A: Velvety 78. And. And there are some, there are some positive things that I'm doing that I said I wasn't. Some positive things that I'm not doing that I said I wasn't going to do, and I'm sticking to it. You tempted me this week. You sent me a freaking video that you saw on Twitter of Butch Harmon talking about his favorite thing he ever taught, Tiger woods. And it was like a 2000 Golf channel video. And I know that you were just tempting me to watch it.
Speaker B: I was doing that.
Speaker A: Yeah. And I didn't watch it. I watched a second of it and then I. I fled.
Speaker B: I may have glanced at it.
Speaker A: I threw the phone and I ran and took a cold shower. And I said, no, I will not. No.
Speaker B: That's impressive.
Speaker A: So your confidence level right now is low, as you've just said. But I don't need to remind you that we are a mere three weeks away from the octagon.
Speaker B: Just hearing that brings a tear to my eye.
Speaker A: I mean, what are you going to do to turn this around for the biggest golf trip of the year?
Speaker B: While we both got out of the starting gate in different fashion, all that mattered was that we were one month away from the most important event of the year, the octagon. Now the octagonal, was an event that Mike and I had basically hatched about two years ago in an attempt to try to convince our wives that we should be allowed to take yet another golf trip each year together. This is turned into an annual event that takes place on the Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail in Alabama. In true Ryder cup style, Mike has seven teammates from North Carolina and I have seven teammates from Kentucky.
Speaker A: Yeah, so it's North Carolina versus Kentucky. Three days, five rounds in a Ryder cup format. So the first two days are team formats and the final day is singles.
Speaker B: Since Mike and I were the two captains, we always rigged the singles matches to where he and I got to play each other. In years past, singles day has been a spectacle, not so much because of the quality of play, but for the fact that Mike and I were basically in a full blown war of attrition. Needless to say, it isn't exactly beautiful golf. This year, though, we went into the octagon with high hopes.
Speaker A: Yeah. To be honest, I was still riding high off of my 78. And Eli wasn't as down as he was at the start. He had managed to talk himself back into some positivity by the time we got to Alabama. So we're not going to get into all the details of the trip, but here is some actual live recording that we did the night before our singles match. Needless to say, our first two rounds did not go well. Okay, is there.
Speaker B: Is there a way out of this tomorrow? Do we. Do we. Is there a way where we don't have to play?
Speaker A: How are we at the point where we don't want to finish a golf trip?
Speaker B: Can I donate, like, can I donate a point? Can we both donate a point tomorrow and just neutral out so we don't hurt our teams?
Speaker A: Wait, do we just become like the real Ryder cup captains? Do we go to Radio Shack right now, get a few walkie talkies? Don't even take our clubs to the course. We just take. We just get one of those maintenance carts and we just drive around like.
Speaker B: An nine foot telephone cord that's just.
Speaker A: That connects the two of them, and we just. We just talk. We just act like we're talking to nobody.
Speaker B: That sounds like such a better idea than going out and actually playing golf tomorrow. I don't even want to. I don't even want to subject people on the course to having to watch our match.
Speaker A: So at the end of the day, we decided to play. Unfortunately, it was not good. A few days after we got back, we got on the phone for a long honesty hour. So can I get into my first honesty point here?
Speaker B: Do it. Let's go.
Speaker A: So there were moments, specifically. So in the singles match, which you handily beat me. Actually, just. Just for the record, you won the first three. You were three up after three, then we were all square after six, then you were three up after nine, and then we kind of leveled out. And I think you won four and three or something. But the second hole, the par three.
Speaker B: Yep.
Speaker A: I think you hit a six iron.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: And it was. It was during the beta test. The. The.
Speaker B: It was very early on in the beta test.
Speaker A: The fake three quarter swing.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: But it was the smoothest swing. It was. It was scary. I was scared. I didn't think that. I was. I was. I was actually wondering. I was like, if he keeps that swing up, I can't win today. Well, I couldn't win today regardless what swing you're using, because I was so bad. But. But that swing. That swing on the second hole was. That was legit. That. That was the nicest swing you've ever had. So.
Speaker B: Well, that's very.
Speaker A: I want to be. That's incorrect. I wanted to be honest and say, you need to find that and just.
Speaker B: Rinse, replica, and repeat.
Speaker A: The bad news was by hole four. I didn't see that swing again.
Speaker B: No, the beta test. Well, I. Here's the way it started. The beta test was one under after three and was feeling fantastic. Three stress free holes, nice easy swings, fairway balls, green in regulations. So I decided at the fourth hole that I should abandon the beta test and take the hardest iron swing I could possibly muster.
Speaker A: But anyway. Well, that's.
Speaker B: It was.
Speaker A: That's encouraging, though.
Speaker B: It was encouraging.
Speaker A: All right. Do you want me to keep going with my honesty or do you want to give me some honest feedback? You want to stay on you?
Speaker B: Let's. I think we could rapid fire a couple honesty moments.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker B: Since we spent. Since we spent three days together. So my honesty moment number one is a bit of an odd honesty moment in that I don't know what's wrong with your swing. And what I mean by that is you and I know each other's swings so well. I mean, like I said, almost 20 years of seeing our golf swings, right? This is the first time I've ever played with you. And you've played. You've played this bad that there wasn't something glaring in your swing that was just blatantly obvious.
Speaker A: I'm glad that you actually have something positive because that's somewhat positive that at least I didn't look as bad as I felt I did.
Speaker B: No, you didn't look bad at all.
Speaker A: So that's good. All right. All right. Now I'm gonna. I've got. I've got two negative. Two negative honesty points.
Speaker B: Hit me.
Speaker A: These are not gonna be a surprise, but I've got examples. I think the best way to state this next one is you elicit a lot of fear from your opponents on the tee. Yes. And then the fear goes completely away.
Speaker B: The fear goes to joy. Unbridled. The fear goes to unbridled enthusiasm.
Speaker A: You elicit zero fear when you have an iron in your hands. This is true. Specifically a short iron. There were. And this is. I'm just being completely honest. There were because I'm. I'm playing you. And there are times I remember there was a par five. You were within 30 yards in two, and I was back in the fairway hitting my third shot from like, 150. And I thought, you thought there's no.
Speaker B: Going to win the hole.
Speaker A: I really did I thought I was going to win the hole, at least. At least tie it, which we did tie it, because you left your. You left your approach. I think you hit. It was a 30 yard pitch. I think you hit it 15 yards.
Speaker B: I know what you're talking. I know it's the par. It's a par five over the water.
Speaker A: Yep. But the. The same. The first, the exact same hole. So I'm playing with my brother, and, you know, it's his. My brother's 25. It's his first time playing in this. This event. So everybody has some nerves going. I'm thinking he might have some more nerves going. You just hit this bomb. And he marvels at the bomb. And I literally told him, I said, don't worry, this is not going on the green.
Speaker B: And then you said, nostradamus illuminati.
Speaker A: I know that that's not a surprise to you, but. No, there is. There's no fear. There's no fear when. When you are. When you've got a wedge.
Speaker B: You're absolutely right. I need to get more consistent with my irons. Most of the time, I'm not gonna have more than a nine iron coming into a green. So I have got to be able to just hit. Hit greens without thinking, with a nine and a wedge, and that's going to cover 80% of the iron yardage that I'm going to have in.
Speaker A: Agreed. All right, I'm ready for my next moment of. I got one more honesty thing for you. What do you got for me?
Speaker B: All right, you want it? We'll go ahead and hit yours, and then I'll hit mine.
Speaker A: All right, this is a repeat, but your putter has got to go.
Speaker B: And I have no argument there. It's awful. It is so bad.
Speaker A: But I pick on your putter because it's the prophecy, and it looks like it came from a sale at sports authority. But. But I think. I think you might just need a fundamentally different stroke, especially on short putts. So I'll give. And I'll give you an example. In our first match, one of the few holes that I contributed was the critical 16th.
Speaker B: Yes. Where I three putted.
Speaker A: Yes. But I almost gave you that putt.
Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
Speaker A: And it was. Now it was.
Speaker B: It was. It was outside of the.
Speaker A: It was probably a putter and a half length away, but I think I would have given that to just about anybody. But when I saw the gleaming head of the copper, when you saw walking.
Speaker B: Towards, you saw the far silhouette on the green.
Speaker A: And the reason I was also so apt to give it to you is I had a putt that was double the length on the exact same line for par that I knew I had to putt that you were gonna see the line on.
Speaker B: And you thought any, any normal golfer would take a read here.
Speaker A: But somehow I thought, I think there's a good chance he misses his putt and I think I'm gonna make money.
Speaker B: See, here's the question. What is the issue behind. What is the issue behind my putting? Is it. See, there's.
Speaker A: I have a theory.
Speaker B: Go ahead.
Speaker A: I think on your mid range to short putts, like anything 10ft in, I don't think you're aggressive enough through the ball.
Speaker B: Okay, so I'm.
Speaker A: I deselling. I think it's. It's close to a desell. That's what I don't know. That would be my last honesty point. All right, I'm ready. I've given you like five honesty points, and you've only given me a kind one. So I'm ready. I'm ready for the thunder.
Speaker B: I'm coming, I'm coming. Here's my first thunder point.
Speaker A: All right, I'm ready.
Speaker B: I'm trying to remember the whole number. It was on the first round. It was a long hole, a very long hole. Tough downhill, uphill, skinny fairway. And you pulled out the iron and it was at this point in the first round of day one that I knew he's already abandoned the driver.
Speaker A: Well, there was a reason for that.
Speaker B: Though, and it was. I know a lot of it had to do with match play, and a.
Speaker A: Lot of it had to do with match play. And also it had to do with. I had hit one fairway.
Speaker B: I agree. But I think until, until you battle through this thing, until the driver becomes your most confident club, you are never going to be able to shave strokes.
Speaker A: I understand. I'm in complete agreement with that. And that will, that's not a long term thing. That was because I was trying to win a match and my little brother was carrying me all day.
Speaker B: No, I agree. But I think. I think mentally, I think mentally, you're still at a place where you feel like you can always check down. You can always go. You can always go to the iron if you need to. And I think you're almost gonna have to burn that iron so that you never hit it off a par four unless it's just a complete. Unless the whole dictates that hitting a driver is stupid. You need to go the driving range like we talked about. You talked about hitting 100 wedges at the driving range. You hit your wedge fantastic. You don't need to bring a club for, like, a month. You need to hit driver every single time because your other. You hit your iron so well, you scramble so well, you putt so well. But none of that stuff gets infused with confidence because your driver is so bad.
Speaker A: This is. This is tough talk. This is what I need.
Speaker B: It is. You've got to find a way. You have got to find a way to put balls in play. Not that it had. Not that you have to hit them 300 yards down the fairway, but you have got, you. You've got to put every club away until you figure out how to hit the driver. Hitting. Hitting an iron or a putter or anything else is completely pointless.
Speaker A: Thoughts? I agree with that to a large extent. First of all, I'm not going to burn my three iron. Can't do that.
Speaker B: I didn't literally mean burn.
Speaker A: I know. I know. You're right. Well, but your premise is exactly right, though. I've got to, first of all, to keep playing golf. I've got to get the ball and play because there's nothing. Golf is not fun when you cannot find your ball.
Speaker B: Yeah. And I have to tell you, I was early on. This is the first time he's met you in person. But starting on, like, the. It was like the 7th or 8th hole is when you hit your, like, four hole streak of basically losing a drive. Your first. Your drive went. It was done. Was it ten? That was the par four. Hard around the corner. Dog leg. Yeah. So early wine and I took that hole, and I want to say we tied it or we cut it to one or whatever it was. The match got really tight, and so early on, kind of started running his mouth a little bit, and you did not even acknowledge it. And.
Speaker A: Wow. Well, that's hilarious because I don't. I. I think I was seeing so much red at that point. I can't tell you what he said at all. I don't remember him.
Speaker B: Well, you might not even remember, but on the 11th tee box, when he was teeing off, I walked up behind you and I went. I went, are you good? I said, did we. I said, did we say something, or are you just furious at yourself? And you went, I've lost four balls in a row off the tee. I was like, okay, it's you.
Speaker A: Well, not only that, but the ranger was on us because of me. And you know, you know me. That is the. That is the. That drives me. I cannot handle it. I cannot handle when we're playing slow. And I especially can't handle it if we're playing slow because of me.
Speaker B: Yep.
Speaker A: So, yes, that was. That was a bad stretch. So even after the honesty and encouragement Eli tried to give me, I still couldn't get over that this was yet another golf trip where my swing fell completely apart. Alabama had a deep effect on me, and I did some things that I wasn't proud of. So I felt the need to come clean in a new podcast segment we're calling confessions. Well, do you want to hear about my moral failure?
Speaker B: I do want to hear about your moral. Moral failure.
Speaker A: All right, well, we've covered Alabama, so you realize that I was at a pretty low point thinking. Thinking about our quest here. On the way back. On the flight home, I was. I was basically thinking I was in a bad spot. I was just saying, I was thinking, like, how could you even think that you. Like, it's embarrassing to even think that we named something with the word scratch in it, with how bad I just played. Like, there's. There's. There's no way we're even worthy of that.
Speaker B: Yeah. Just not to interrupt you, because I want you to continue, but just to echo that, at one point on. At one point on Friday afternoon, I told Darren, who was my playing partner, I need a new hobby. And I told him, I said, is there anything I'm good at that I could just throw myself into? And it can become the new thing that I do. I said, because clearly, it's not golf.
Speaker A: Is it art? Can I be in. Can I become an artist?
Speaker B: Is there anything out there that I'm good at that I could just claim this is what I do now?
Speaker A: Yes.
Speaker B: So, anyway.
Speaker A: So, anyway, I'm in a vulnerable state, and I get home, and over the. Over the first couple days, I'm home, you know, I don't really touch a club, and I don't really. Not really thinking about golf a whole lot. And Friday night, girls go to bed early. I'm awake, and I've never been on drugs, so I don't know what a bender is like, but I'm pretty sure I did exactly what I told you I wasn't going to do at the start of this.
Speaker B: You started filming yourself.
Speaker A: Not only did I start filming myself.
Speaker B: Here we go.
Speaker A: Actually, actually, I didn't film myself, but I did set up a reflection to where I was looking in the living room. But I went on probably a two hour YouTube bender.
Speaker B: Oh, boy.
Speaker A: Where I was watching every video that I could get my hands on.
Speaker B: That's not good.
Speaker A: But the GR, the best part was I was at the lowest point, and then somehow I convinced myself on Saturday morning, I went to the, I was gonna go the range, and I had it all figured out.
Speaker B: Here we go.
Speaker A: I had a new swing based on.
Speaker B: 2 hours of YouTube, based on the.
Speaker A: YouTube bender that I went on. And I basically had a brand new backswing, which we've already covered, was not the problem.
Speaker B: It was not broken at all.
Speaker A: But I figured I, but I said, you know what? This is? I think this is it. I think this is what I was doing. And I went to the range, and I. Probably 60% of my shots were shanks.
Speaker B: Are you kidding me?
Speaker A: Just straight hosel shanks into a little warehouse. I just yelled, said, rome, something is wrong. Something's terribly wrong.
Speaker B: My swing feels like an unfolded lawn chair.
Speaker A: So I come back and I realize I'm on the way home, driving on the way home, and I'm just thinking to myself, how could you do this again? You know, you know what happens? You know, you can't do, you know, this doesn't work. And I'm, I'm at the, at my lowest point, and somehow by the end of the day Saturday, I've got it figured out again.
Speaker B: Here we go.
Speaker A: But I. Not, not because of YouTube. I went, I went back, I went back to my, to my, to my old lesson notes from, like, four years ago. There he is. I called my guy, got have a lesson on Wednesday. Okay. I'm back committed to what I said. I'm gonna listen to him. I'm not gonna. Not gonna do anything else. I just practiced a couple drills that he gave me the last time I saw him, and I'm feeling I'm in a better spot. But that was my more. That was my moral failure.
Speaker B: Here's. Do we need to. I think that we need to re emphasize. We need to make a, we need to make a pact inside this pact, double pact. We are only going to take the advice of professionals who are looking at our swing, period.
Speaker A: I agree. I agree with that. Is there some sort of software that we can put on our computers that alerts the other one if the other one watches a golf video?
Speaker B: You mean like porn? Accountability. Like you.
Speaker A: That's what I'm saying.
Speaker B: Up to where if you watch an adult website, it goes to a friend of yours, so he can say.
Speaker A: That's what I'm saying. Can we set the same thing for, like, if I go to golfdigest.com, it alerts you immediately, obviously, we have problems. And unfortunately, after Alabama, our problems weren't over. What you are about to hear are actual conversations that we had throughout the fall. As you can tell, we were rattled and head casing was going to reach an all time high. Here's the deal. Just finished a round. I've come to the conclusion that we need to change the name of this quest.
Speaker C: If it ever becomes a podcast.
Speaker A: It cannot be called chasing scratch. It needs to be called dreaming of six.
Speaker C: But it's the same. It's the same. Like, my driver shot me in the foot, like, nine holes.
Speaker B: I could not hit a driver to save my life.
Speaker C: So extremely. It's extremely frustrating because we've never shot par. I've never shot close to par.
Speaker A: How can we hope to average par in a year? Just dumb.
Speaker C: This is a dumb goal.
Speaker B: Are you a ball of rage or what are you thinking?
Speaker A: I'm not a ball of rage. I'm kind of despondent.
Speaker C: He would say it should feel like a whip. You get back. That initial transition is like, you got a whip in your hand. Here's the problem I have with that.
Speaker A: Not that that's wrong.
Speaker C: Yeah. Have you ever held a whip? No, I'm not a dungeon master. Me neither am I. Who holds a whip? I think it was an analogy that you could visualize without actually being into SNM. I'm just saying. I get the analogy, but what's always hard for me is, like, I've never held a whip.
Speaker A: I'm not Indiana Jones.
Speaker C: Is that what I'm missing? Do I need Indy's hat today? Well, my question is, should we get a whip? But I'm struggling with a way forward, and I don't like it's. I can't self correct whatever is going on.
Speaker A: I had one last chance to salvage the fall with a trip in early November to Atlanta to play with friends of the podcast, Brian and Tyler from the Hosel Jockeys golf podcast, and also a friend of the podcast, Brett Talley. The great news is, I had a lot of fun with these guys, and because of Brett's play, we won that day's match. But when it came to analyzing my own game, all you need to know about the round is in the audio you're about to hear. This was recorded the morning after I returned from the tripod.
Speaker C: I know we're gonna save a good chunk of this for the pod, but can I just get. Can I get a tease?
Speaker A: You get the whole thing.
Speaker C: I've got the recorder out. Okay, well, I'm salivating. So fill me in. There's not really much to say. I'm not any good. I'm never going to get any better. And there's just. There's just not much to say. This is just. It's a failed mission that I'm going to continue to fail for the rest of the rest of my life for the listening audience. I texted you. I texted you halfway through my round to see how you were doing and what I got. I just want. I just want to read. I just want to read what I got back. This is what it said. Hold on, I'm going to it. I almost just killed the passenger of an approaching car. That was it. It was one, if not the greatest text message I've ever received. I was on the 9th hole. I was riding with Lee, and I just couldn't tell what was going on because I was laughing so hard. Well, it could not have been truer. There was a. I was on the. I think I was on the 9th hole too, when you texted me that. And there's a road on the left side of the fairway. I take driver out and rope one and it was literally 70 yards left of target. Just a direct pull. And it was the height of the passengers temple.
Speaker B: Like it was.
Speaker A: It was tracking.
Speaker C: The trajectory was tracking straight on a temple shop.
Speaker A: And.
Speaker C: That'S how the driver went.
Speaker B: So here we were. An entire fall had just went by. Daylight savings was gone, the temperatures were dropping, and unfortunately our handicaps were not. My handicap had ballooned to a 12.5 while Mike had managed to move his down just half a point, ending the fall at a 10.8. Needless to say, this was not what we envisioned when we started this quest. We knew heading into the winter, something had to change.
Speaker A: Yeah, at this point, we honestly did not know if we were even going to produce this podcast. Podcast. So what changed? Next time on chasing scratch.
