Speaker A: Eli, it's season seven.
Speaker B: Good gosh. How did it get here, 7th season?
Speaker A: I don't know. But before we get started, I just wanted to say a sincere thank you, Lenny. Maybe some sentimental music here. Thank you to everyone who listens to.
Speaker B: Us and supports us. We are very grateful we get to do this.
Speaker A: When we started, we would never have thought there would be a season seven that we were starting. So kudos to everyone who listens and also our friends at Titleist. Kudos to you guys. They are partners of ours. They make the best stuff in the game, but they're also like family to us.
Speaker C: Yep.
Speaker A: And those people have helped us grow and learn and continue to move forward. So we can't say enough thank you to Titleist.
Speaker B: Couldn't, couldn't agree more.
Speaker A: Okay, that said, eli, are we ready to start season seven?
Speaker B: Let's get nuts.
Speaker A: Lenny, let's start. We are two guys in our early forties. We've got wives, kids, jobs, and we start the season with shaky three handicaps. This is chasing scratch. Season seven and this episode is called the Larry file.
Speaker D: Please hold while we find an available support agent to assist you. Thank you for contacting the USDA championship administration department. All of our associates are currently busy or assisting other customers at this time.
Speaker A: It was February 1, 2024, and I was leaving a voicemail for the United States Golf association. Hi, my name is Mike, and I had a question. I'm not sure if I'm in the right department or not, but hoping someone could help me. I'm wondering. I was leaving this voicemail because of something that Larry said to Eli. And thats what this episode is all about. This is the story of the Larry file. To tell the story of the Larry file correctly, we gotta go all the way back, back to the end of last season, the first week of November, 2023. Letting fire up the contemplative music we always end the season with. Heres the last piece of audio Eli and I recorded for season six. So the last thing is, when are we coming back? When does season seven start?
Speaker B: Gosh, I think that's a great way to end it.
Speaker A: Yeah. And then I come back.
Speaker B: I think you narrate that.
Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. All right.
Speaker B: I'm gonna kill it.
Speaker A: Okay. I narrated the rest of the episode because we didn't know exactly when we were coming back, nor did we have a good idea for what season seven was going to look like. The only thing we knew for sure was we were gassed. Season six was probably our most rewarding season, but it was also the longest podcast season we'd ever put out. We decided we needed a little time off to recharge. So the plan was to take two months off from recording golf conversations and start back in January. We made it almost two weeks. One afternoon in November, Eli called me from the car and demanded an emergency recording session. So, ten minutes later, we were on the mics. Well, let's just timestamp this real, real quick. This is November 20.
Speaker B: Yeah, November 12. I just had my first meeting with Larry.
Speaker A: We're supposed to be taking a week. We're supposed to be taking months off. Yeah, we're supposed to be taking a vacation from ourselves. You said this would be better. That's what I still have. This beard.
Speaker B: Your playoff beard. Well, I just. I had to call you. Look for anybody listening. I called Mike on the way home. I said, get on the microphone right when you get in, when I get back from the house, I'm calling you.
Speaker A: I don't know how you shot even part of that, but that's. That was the sound in your voice.
Speaker B: That kind of sound.
Speaker A: Are we queueing the dramatic music?
Speaker B: No. Dramatic music. Oh, heck, no. It's freaking freezing outside. Larry Solari and I had our meeting to talk about the offseason plan. Larry said something during the meeting. You know, we're going through. Hey, you need to do this. I think this is a good idea. You know, we're going through all. All the things he wants to focus on. He said, all right. He said, I've got an idea for something. And it blew my mind when he said it. And part of it was just the way he said it, but he said, look, here's the deal.
Speaker A: So Eli had made a recording of what Larry said, but he didn't play that for me. He instead explained it himself for the next four minutes. Have you ever been in a situation where someone's telling you something they're really excited about, and as much as you want to, you can't honestly match that level of excitement? That's what was going on here. I was trying not to shoot the idea down, but I didn't want to fake being excited, either. After a few minutes, Eli could tell by my tone I wasn't quite on board.
Speaker B: Like I said, maybe I overhyped this, but it was to me. I feel like the light bulb went off.
Speaker A: Yeah, I'm just. I'm just trying to figure out how that translates to a full year.
Speaker B: I don't either like that. I have no idea. I finished the lesson with him 25 minutes ago.
Speaker A: I gotcha.
Speaker B: But I just. It's like I told you in the car, I need you to start. You are the game's master. Trash cable. We've got two. Intramural crawl ball. What was wiffle tennis? I mean, I could go on and on and on about games you've invented, but I need your mind. You're like Costanza. I need your. I need access to your dementia. I need you. I need you to start marinating on this.
Speaker A: I'll get my. I'll get my peanut butter jar out, and I'll get to work. All right?
Speaker B: I need you on it.
Speaker A: All right, let's do it. So the plan was this. Eli was going to send me the recording of what Larry had said, the aforementioned Larry file, and I was going to listen to it. And if I'm honest, I was hoping that whatever was on it was better than what Eli had just summarized, because I wanted to be as excited as Eli, but based on what he was saying, I doubted my ability to get there. But Eli didn't send the recording. I texted him a few reminders, but as we covered last year, Eli and texting don't really mix. So I called him a couple days after. Did you upload the Larry file?
Speaker C: Uh.
Speaker B: I will do that right now.
Speaker A: Okay, perfect. You'll be shocked to know he did not upload it right then. And so the awkward phase of trying to acquire the Larry file began.
Speaker B: And I'll send you the audio. But I thought I did that already. But maybe you sent it to me. You asked for it, and I refused to send it back to you immediately.
Speaker A: Because I probably sent it you to.
Speaker B: I didn't want to get triggered. I sent it to you in a text, and then. And Christina said, send him that audio. And I went, no. He said, yeah, I made that request 10 seconds ago. I will send it to him in a little bit.
Speaker A: All right. And I do need Larry's audio.
Speaker B: I'll send it again.
Speaker A: I can listen to it.
Speaker B: You could always go back through your text thread and just find it, but you did not.
Speaker A: You did not.
Speaker B: Here I go again. I'll have to dig out a piece of audio that you can't find. All right, I'll send it.
Speaker A: Please. I mean, just right now, right? No, no, no. Stop playing around.
Speaker B: You're gonna forget how many times you struggle to open things that I've sent you.
Speaker A: But I'll stop it.
Speaker B: Let's see if you can actually do it this time. I'll send it again.
Speaker A: All right, well, can you just. Can you just send me what he actually said.
Speaker B: Yeah, I'm hoping. I'm going through my voice memos now. I had to clear some space two days ago, and I thought you already had it. Oh. Oh. Okay. They're all in recently deleted. So I'm okay.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker B: Yeah, we're okay now.
Speaker A: We're in recently deleted. We're good.
Speaker B: Everything's good. Don't panic.
Speaker A: Even after this, I still didn't receive the file, so I stopped asking. And the Larry file just sat in the recently deleted folder in Eli's voice notes app, set to permanently delete in 29 days. And pretty quickly after that, I forgot about it. After all, there were plenty of other things to think about. It was early December at this point, and it was time to get into offseason training mode.
Speaker D: The couple shots that I watched you hit at the final major that weren't your best were your tenancy. Every player has a tendency, and we're always working to pull you away from that tendency.
Speaker A: This is my coach, the ambassador of Quan, the greatest golf coach in the history of the Internet, Jason Nickel. And what you're hearing is a video he sent me outlining our off season plan. The things we were going to work on in December, January, and February.
Speaker D: And what happens is, as you get tired and stressed more under pressure, you'll want to revert back to that. So we need, like, all our drills, all our feels, all our exercises to move you closer to your new swing so that the new swing becomes the swing.
Speaker A: It was super detailed with daily drills, ball counts. I even made it into an excel spreadsheet and bought a clipboard to hang in the garage to check off every day. But as I started the first day of drills, on the second ball of the day, I felt it. A sharp pain in my right wrist, the same one I'd injured last year. And that's when Riscait began.
Speaker E: So here's some of the images from the MRI. So, thumb side over here, ulna, radius. These are the carpal bones. All the white is the contrast that they injected in there. And then the TFCC is this dark spot here.
Speaker A: Long story short, after a few doctors visits and an MRI, I found out I had torn cartilage. The good news was I didn't need surgery. The bad news was I'd need to shut it down for six weeks for the wrist to heal. There was no hitting balls, no using the stack, no lifting heavy weights. My off season plans were put on hold. Eli, though, was back at it. He was back on the stack system and back at it. With Larry getting lessons once a week, that's exactly what we're after. Awesomeness. Absolute awesomeness. -0.5 left. Down five. Eight. Out. Two, six.
Speaker E: Bingo.
Speaker A: Good, good, good. Golf swing. I have to say that the swings he was sending me looked very good. But there were no actual golf rounds for Eli over the offseason because, as per usual, his weather was cold and wet. His free time was spent mostly in a basketball gym. As for me, my off season could not be about my golf swing. So I decided to rededicate myself to the gym. 960 calories burned. If I can't hit golf balls, I'm gonna be in freaking amazing shape. I'll just say that now we're getting.
Speaker E: Back into a workout routine this week. I'm still super excited about doing more of this progressive, adding on some muscle, some strength for you over the off season and really taking advantage of that. Wanted to see how you're feeling with the 5 grams of creatine, 140 grams.
Speaker A: Of protein you may remember from last season. That's our nerd fitness coach, Matt. He made me a fitness and nutrition plan for the off season, and I followed it pretty good. I was in the gym at least three times every week, and I tightened up the diet. 140 grams of protein a day is a lot of chicken, by the way. And while I'm not an Adonis or anything like that, I will say I'm in the best physical shape I've been in since season one, and maybe even better than back then. Kudos to Matt. Meanwhile, while Eli was heavily motivated golf wise, the lessons with Larry, the stack system, his diet and exercise routine were becoming so bad that at one point in December, I felt like I had to step in and bring some concerned honesty. Can I be honest with you? I'm starting to get worried.
Speaker B: You should.
Speaker A: Like, I'm actually not even, I'm not even trying to tell a joke here. I'm actually starting to worry because you're 42 years old.
Speaker B: Do you, do you think there's a reason I'm eating eggs and drinking water right now? We have the same legitimate worries and concerns.
Speaker A: Okay. Okay, that's good. Eli assured me he was back focused. He even said he was going to reach back out to our coach, Matt, and get back on a plane. But then, like, five days later, Matt sent me this message.
Speaker E: Um, and then, if I can, I actually will ask you to let Eli know that I just sent him over a video, and I don't know if he's got me on, like, mute or if he gets my text or not right now, but. So.
Speaker A: So, you know, I had to ask Eli about that. He has now reached out through me because you won't respond in any way. And so I'm just coming to you now and saying, just. Just deal with it if you're not gonna. But I'm.
Speaker B: I need to connect with Matt, but I have so little motivation until January 1 to do anything healthy right now.
Speaker A: You were motivated last week.
Speaker B: No, no, no. I was motivated to golf. And I've went to Larry. I've done my. I've done my golf stuff. I've been to the simulator. I just have no desire to put anything positive in my body until it's 2024.
Speaker A: At the start of January, Eli again stated he was getting focused. But then a week later, he sent me this from the McDonald's drive thru.
Speaker D: 623.
Speaker A: How are you doing?
Speaker B: I'm good, man. How you doing?
Speaker A: Good.
Speaker C: Did you like a receipt today?
Speaker B: No, I'm good, thank you.
Speaker C: He didn't say it, but that's Broman.
Speaker A: He's back. My life suddenly has meaning about then. It was mid January and time for our first official season seven recording of 2024. And of course, the topic Eli wanted to start out with was another claim. He was going to focus on getting in shape, and I was not in the mood to listen. But then yesterday, we had a conversation off air. Off air. And you said, you're making an effort right now.
Speaker B: I am making an effort right now.
Speaker A: And I immediately said, I don't believe you. Mm hmm. You will go back on this. You will not follow through. And then we realize that's probably what you need the most.
Speaker E: Yep.
Speaker B: Constant doubt, but, yeah, constant doubt. It's so much better than encouragement. Encouragement does nothing for me. Clearly, accountability couldn't be a more pointless thing in my life. They carry no weight. I have no problem disappointing people that I know. It's not an issue, but doubt me, and it is enough to. It's enough to push me over the edge.
Speaker A: So we didn't. We didn't go into full detail, but the idea was I was going to just, every day I'm gonna set alarm on my phone, I'm just gonna send some insult.
Speaker B: Yes. It has to come from a place of true doubt, that true hate. There's any love and support tied to it, I'm out.
Speaker A: I mean, I truly do doubt you. You've. I've been fooled so many times that you're actually gonna do. You're actually gonna do this. Yeah. I mean, there's zero. I can just be honest when you, when you get it, for me, it's just honesty. Yeah.
Speaker B: That's why I said I don't doubt. I don't doubt your honesty. You're not trying to psych me up. I know your heartless responses. I know when they're genuine. I know when your heartless response. I know when it's a true heartless response. There's a certain temperament you have. When you completely annihilate something, there's a certain tone.
Speaker A: I want to hear this. It's.
Speaker B: It's a quick response with no care at all. When you're like, that's not going to work. No, like, when I suggest, like, when I suggest, like, a time or something, you're like, no, but you don't laugh about it. You're like, there's a tone. You go to where you're like, yet it's like, I don't care.
Speaker A: That's.
Speaker B: That's dumb. And it's not gonna work. When I get that tone. That's what I need. I need that tone to drive me to a better place because I know it's legit. You are not playing around.
Speaker A: Man. I gotta tap into that.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: Gosh, I don't even realize I'm doing that.
Speaker B: Find that voice more often.
Speaker A: All right, well, tell me what you're trying to do. Tell me what you're.
Speaker B: So I was like, okay, I just need to start stringing together wins in week one. So my week one wins were I wanted to have a protein shake as my breakfast six of the seven days this week. I was like, I'm gonna eat McDonald's one day if I can just go six of the seven, which I'm two for two this week. So I've had protein shakes.
Speaker A: There we go.
Speaker B: And I was like, okay, if I can do that, at least.
Speaker A: Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no, not there we go. There's no way you'll hit six. It's not gonna. Hold on. What tone? What tone?
Speaker B: You have to go quick. It's like, yeah, it's not gonna happen.
Speaker A: That's not gonna work.
Speaker B: Yeah, there it is. That was dead on. That was it. To a table. When do I do that? Oh, a healthy amount. Healthy amount of time. Oh, yeah. I don't dislike it. I would have told you if I disliked it. It's brilliant.
Speaker A: Is it? But is it like when we're trying to plan something on a calendar and I'm like, oh, yeah, no, that doesn't work. Okay.
Speaker B: Or if, like, if I have an idea. Like, an idea for the show. And you're like, I'm gonna be honest. I don't see that happening. There's a difference in your. I'm gonna be honest. I don't think I see that happening. That's option one. Then there's. I'm gonna be honest, I don't see that happening. Like, that's option two. Option two. Option two is dead in the water. Like, don't bring it up again.
Speaker A: No, I think that whenever you, whenever you come up with an idea that involves more of your time. I've gone to a quick yes. I've gone to a quick no. But it's a, but it's a good meme. I'm not going to entertain it because.
Speaker B: That'S what I mean.
Speaker A: It's.
Speaker B: It's a good. It's a guy. That's why I like the voice, because it's almost a cue for me. Like, hey, moron, you can't do that. He went to the voice, like, what are you doing? That involves way too much time. I'm like, oh, yeah, that's a good point. I can't do that.
Speaker A: Oh, man, that's good. I'm so glad I have a voice. I didn't know that.
Speaker B: Yeah, there you go.
Speaker A: All right, well, you're not. You're not gonna do that.
Speaker B: You're not hitting six or seven days.
Speaker A: This plane's stupid. We eventually moved off that topic and moved on to the season ahead. We have a recording like this at the start of every season where we discuss ideas for our games and for the show. And normally by this time, we've got a pretty good idea of what we want to do. But this year, it sounded like this. Let's talk about show structure. Okay. I don't have one. I don't know. Like.
Speaker B: I talk about show structure. Okay, I don't have one.
Speaker A: I mean, so what I meant here was our goals and how we decided to go about them. That's what drives the structure for the content of any season. But for season seven, we weren't sure what those were. Of course, the goal of every season is getting to scratch, but what were we going to do specifically this season to achieve it? Did we have an intermediate goal we wanted to commit to? Last year, we did the gauntlet, a weekly competition between Eli and I. Would we run that back this year? We'd also talked about playing competitive events in season seven, but how many and what should our goals be for that? We were debating all of that, and then Eli said, this.
Speaker B: The goal is always zero. That doesn't change. But have you put any more thought into the Larry stuff that I talked to you about?
Speaker A: It took me a second to remember what Eli was referring to. And then it hit me. Oh, yeah, the Larry file. It turns out Eli had saved it from his deleted folder. He just never sent it. And he finally sent it to me that day. And so later that night, I finally heard what Larry said to Eli that had gotten him so excited that day back in November.
Speaker F: This was going to be my suggestion for you. I would almost go to the team aspect.
Speaker C: What do you mean?
Speaker F: So you, dude, you guys are such.
Speaker C: What?
Speaker F: You're like, best possible friends anybody could be. Y'all never gonna have a killer instinct for each other. No, that ain't never gonna happen. And no matter what you say or what he says, you guys are never not gonna be influenced by the other one when you're out there playing those games. I would strongly suggest it would be kind of cool if you could find your old Darth Vader.
Speaker A: Less than a minute in, Larry had me hooked just like Eli was. I kept listening, but it's so funny you said that.
Speaker C: I don't know if you listen. The second to last episode, when we played tobacco Road, the whole tobacco road day was a two man deal, and he and I were on the same team. And I told him the night before, everybody was getting a drink. And I said, hey, I said, I thrive when the competition, like, I don't mean, I just mean it juices everything, you know. I said, let's just come out here and talk trash the whole night. And we ran our mouths to everybody all night. And two of our good buddies who were good, we ended up putting down a healthy major. The night before that, we would beat him. And Mike and I, I went one over. Mike went two over. It was the best we've ever played together. But we were on a team together.
Speaker F: That's right.
Speaker C: But we were playing our own ball. But I said, you know, and we beat the guys, but we got to the end. He said, did you know? Cause when I bogeyed 18, he said, did you know? You had said, no, I just knew we needed to hit this punt to go to ten under. And he went, you were one. He said, you were even born in 18. He says, you know, and I said, I just no doubt competitive part of the round. And the fact that we were doing something together, and it just blocked everything else out.
Speaker F: Like elite basketball players who played on teams you used to, you really struggle with now that he's gotten better, it's not been as big of a deal, but you really struggle with him failing. Some of those early podcasts I've listened to is you're truly.
Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker F: You know, when he's kind of going through it a little bit.
Speaker E: Yeah.
Speaker F: And then this last one, he hated to beat you.
Speaker A: You could just.
Speaker B: It did.
Speaker C: Well, I said, I mean, he hated. But even if you hear us talk, it's like, I'm okay losing tomorrow as long as we both play well, you know, it's like, that's not. You would never go into a competition. Like, I'm okay losing his life. You'd be like, no freaking want to win.
Speaker F: But you could tell that he was kind of like, you know, a little bit like, bum.
Speaker C: Watch the video. I hit that. I hit a long putt on 17 to push the match, and he was walking up to me, fist bumping me, and it was like, yeah, that was.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: I finished the Larry file, and my mind was racing. I went back and pulled what Eli had said to me back in November. Turns out he nailed it. I guess I just wasn't ready to hear it.
Speaker B: Larry, he goes, I don't know the gauntlet, any of that stuff. I think the two of you together, though, I think the two of you together would actually bring out the best in both of your game.
Speaker A: The fact is, we've been getting feedback for years that we're not competitive enough each other. And I think we've been prone to fight against that because we both love to compete. But I think if we're honest, we can rise to the level of worthy competition between each other once a year at the final major. But the other stuff, the gauntlet, the other majors, I don't think that really drives us. In all honesty, we'd rather the other person shot a career low than win one of those. So what Larry was really posing was this question, what will motivate us to improve more competing against each other or with each other? Once I wrapped my head around this, it only took me about ten minutes of Internet research, and I knew what to do. I called Eli and demanded an emergency mic session, just like he had done when he had first heard these same words from Larry. Do you know about the USGA amateur four ball?
Speaker B: No.
Speaker A: Have you ever heard of it?
Speaker B: I mean, I've heard of it. I just don't know a lot about it.
Speaker A: I had never really even heard about. I didn't know it was an official tournament. So if you go to the USga's page. Okay. Like, if you go. If you go to their championships page. Uh huh. It's. It's listed right there. Like, it's like, there's the US am, there's the US Open, there's the mid am, there's the US four bottom.
Speaker B: Don't play with me, Sean. Not you.
Speaker A: Here's my. Here's my idea.
Speaker B: I'm in.
Speaker A: What if this. What if this season did not end with the final major?
Speaker B: Talk to me. Come on.
Speaker A: We still play the final major, but the qualifying for the 2025 four ball, two man, four ball competition is after the final major. Oh, my dear mother, you qualify in October or November to play in May of 2025.
Speaker B: Oh, I'm all over this.
Speaker A: Yes. And I was. And what I was thinking was, go back to what Larry said about if we can play. If we can play as a team in some way. Like, go back to the show. Go back to what we learned at the show.
Speaker B: They go see a show.
Speaker A: They go see a show.
Speaker B: They go see a show.
Speaker A: Like, best we both ever played was.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: In that. In that team format.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Can. Can qualifying for that be the overarching goal of the year? Knowing that doing that is not directly tied to a handicap. But we're gonna get better if we're.
Speaker B: Gonna try to, but we've got to get better if we're gonna really qualify for that. I love this idea. And, okay, couple things. Number one, it's USGA sponsored, so this is legit. It's not like, oh, we're gonna drive over and play this tournament for the weekend. It's like, no, this is.
Speaker A: This is qualifying.
Speaker B: Yeah, there's qualifying, like, legit. Yep. The other thing, too, is we don't know anybody. So the competitive box checking of, like, us wanting to rip everybody's heart out would be fully.
Speaker A: It's right there.
Speaker B: Full go in in the best way possible.
Speaker A: Because if we don't know you, we hate you.
Speaker B: We hate you. We're gonna go full mind street fighter, who was the mortal Kombat character that ripped your heart out. Goro, I want you.
Speaker A: Kano.
Speaker B: Kano, I want you to dub this. This season, Kano. And people are gonna think we're part. We're on a new fad diet. But, no, we're gonna rip everybody's heart out. But, no, I'm. I'm all in on this. Kano. It's full throttle Kano for 2024.
Speaker A: And so that. So then if you start playing that out. We basically already planned this without even knowing it because we have our two man event that will be practiced for this. The Karl Tucky. Mm hmm. And then I'm stormy. I'm just gonna throw one other thing at you.
Speaker B: Throw it.
Speaker A: Do we change the majors for this year to where it's me and you verse a random twosome in a four ball?
Speaker B: Oh, dear mother. Oh.
Speaker A: Just. Just to.
Speaker B: Just the leader, not the final major.
Speaker A: Yeah. No, no, no. The final major is the same.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: What I'm saying is when we get together, shouldn't we be practicing? If. If this is. If this is what we're trying to do.
Speaker B: Oh, I love this.
Speaker A: Yes.
Speaker B: I'm co signing on this 100%.
Speaker A: So the goal was set. 2024 would officially become the year of the Bear shark. The other part I liked about this goal was the handicap limits for the four ball were 5.4, meaning you have to be under a 5.4 handicap to register a mark. We were both comfortably below for the most of the year last year, meaning that while striving for improvement this year, we would not have to get hyper focused on results or a specific handicap number to embark on this quest. That was, of course, until a few days later.
Speaker B: Okay, what you teased yesterday in a very job swing city kind of way, a very Joe Bluth way. I was trying to. I was trying to keep you out, but. You were trying to keep me out. You wouldn't tell me what the deal was. So what. What is the news you've got?
Speaker A: How do we let the teases out? We don't let them in.
Speaker B: We don't let him know. So what? Fill me in. I'm dying here.
Speaker A: All right, Lenny, cue. Cue some narrative change. Music.
Speaker B: Oh, I'm terrified.
Speaker A: There was a change that I was made aware of yesterday to the USGA qualifications.
Speaker B: Shut up.
Speaker A: For this year's championships.
Speaker B: All right, I'm standing on my chair.
Speaker A: What was it? Well, our main goal to qualify for the. For the US amateur four ball at the end of the year. Yeah, the. The minimum handicap, or, I'm sorry, the maximum handicap for the last forever. How that? However long they've done it is 5.4 this year. They got wind we were trying to do this clearly, and they moved it to 2.4.
Speaker B: What?
Speaker A: 2.42.4.
Speaker B: All right, you know what? Look, look. No. We're going to shift our mindset immediately. This is not a problem. And honestly, I'm. This is the biggest mistake the USGA made, because we would have entered this thing feeling we would have entered it wondering if we were playing good golf. Good enough golf but knowing that our handicaps were fine, now we're gonna enter this thing knowing we're playing the best golf of our lives. So I. I don't even give a crap. Usga, you're now in the axis of evil.
Speaker A: We are go. We are coming after you.
Speaker B: Yeah, we're coming at you. I'm gonna come at you like a spy.
Speaker E: We're coming.
Speaker B: You like a spider monkey right now.
Speaker A: I'm going to come at you hard and I'm going to steal all of your clients. Green means go ahead and don't bring it up. Orange is orange. You glad you didn't say it? Most colors mean don't say it. I mean, I mean, but. So here's, so here's what I need. What we need to find out, and I have a contact that I've emailed at the USGA to see if they'll come on. They don't. Now, this person does not know that we have placed the USGA in the axis of evil.
Speaker B: He doesn't know that he's coming on as a rep for. For the axis of evil. But look, Larry said this reverend, in a prophetic statement. He said we need to lean into the team competition. We need a vader. The vader, by the way, could be the USgA. I'm ready to. I'm ready to put them in the Vader category, but let's.
Speaker A: Let's just picture. I like to picture the USGA with a helmet. With a dark helmet.
Speaker B: Can we assign USGA? We need villain music to the US. Lenny, come up with something good.
Speaker A: Find something fantastic.
Speaker B: Evil. I want to hate the music that you put on.
Speaker A: So that's why I called the USGA. I was trying to find out specifically how long did we have to get to 2.4? Did we both have to be under it at the same time? Was it at the time of registration or time of tournament start? I couldn't find any of that listed specifically in any of the rule sheets. I asked a number of our contacts who regularly play in USGA events, and they didn't know either. In fairness to them, they're good enough to where they don't have to worry about it. Kudos to the USGA, though. They were highly responsive and helpful. We got to talk with Brent Palladino, the director of the USGA championships administration team, who's a player himself. He won the New Jersey State Open last August and he graciously answered our questions. So, Brent, you're from the USGA and the championship administration. Can you just. Can you walk us through what your job is. Yeah, absolutely.
Speaker E: So I oversee our championship administration function, and really, the best way to describe that is really all the in house administration of our championships. So that's everything from entries, exemption, qualifying, and all our championship equipment as well. So really kind of all the administrative items of our championship. Probably the. I think the best way to describe it is we used to have a tagline for many, one. So if you think of the US Open, there's 10,000 entries, and eventually it gets whittled down to one champion. I would say my team's job is really taking that 10,000 and delivering the championship field of 156 and then eventually the champion. So we kind of take the 10,000 and whittle it down to the final championship field.
Speaker A: I'll jump in with some questions about that. We had. So Eli and I are. We're trying to be good golfers. We. We've. We've improved the name of the show. We've improved. We've improved a little bit. Last year. Last year, I was excited because I got under a 3.4 handicap and I was like, oh, that's fantastic. And Eli and I were looking at doing the four ball this year, and we noticed that you guys knew that was happening and then you moved the limits. So to keep us out. So we. We see that. I was just going to ask what. What drove, like, what kind of drove that decision to move from? Cause I guess the. The mid am went from three four to two four, and the four ball was five four and it went to two four. Is that right?
Speaker E: Yeah, that's correct. Yeah. I mean, I was really just on our USG admin portal and just watching your all handicaps, and once I saw that, I make sure I moved it down. No, we go through, I would say, a periodic review of all of our eligibility requirements every year going into 2024. And you all may know there was a number of changes that went into USGA qualifying this year, whether it be the USA going to two stages, modifications to our performance policy, and along with that, the handicap index. And really, what we try to do is just ensure that the players competing and qualifying across all our championships are really at the national championship level. And obviously, that's defined different based on the championship. But really, the research went into just seeing, you know, in a given qualifier, in a given year, what kind of the average handicap index is that advance to the championship, what the average scores are across those qualifiers. And really what we saw is that the majority of the players, you know, take the US mid amateur, for example. I think there was only one player that was above a scratch that actually qualified for the championship last year. So, you know, I would say that the other side of it is obviously, we pride ourselves, and certainly why I think, love working for the USGA is just the openness of our championships and the fact that anyone, regardless of your name, your clubs, your skin color, you can sign up and you can play in the USGA national championship. But really, what kind of sparked a lot of the changes this year is just the long term sustainability and viability of USGA qualifying. Every year that I've been with the USGA, this is my fifth season now. We've set record entries for all of our championships, total entries. And this past year, we had in nine records for individual championships as well. And so we run about 700 qualifiers every year. And if you just think across the landscape of golf, obviously golf has become incredibly popular, which is great for, obviously, for all of us, but it's become very difficult for our allied Golf association partners to secure golf courses to run qualifying. And so it's kind of weighing that balance to ensure that, you know, we're able to provide those opportunities for players to be able to compete in qualifying, but also that it's sustainable in the long term. And including with that, like I said, the handicap index, just to ensure that, you know, we have enough spots for players that, you know, have a realistic chance of qualifying.
Speaker A: I get it. I like it. I like it because. Because now we have a target. So here's. Here's what I was going to ask you. So we want to qualify. We want to try to qualify for the four ball this year. And I was looking at the dates on the website, looked like, you know, the last time you can register is August something. So do both of us have to be at a 2.4 at time of registration?
Speaker E: That's correct, yeah. You see, you both have to have a 2.4 handicap or less when you go on to register. Basically, our system will just kind of check your handicap index to ensure that it meets those requirements.
Speaker A: Okay, so what if it. What if it goes up during. In between registration and term? I've always. I've always wondered.
Speaker E: Yeah, so we only check once, once registration occurs. So as long as you meet those requirements when you register, we just. We just look at the time.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker B: Is there a handicap? Is there a point where our handicap could get so low that you don't.
Speaker E: Allow us to enter? You know, I think it's like, I want to say around like a plus nine that it'll. It'll. So, I mean, you got a little work to do, but, you know, the season's just starting, so plenty of time.
Speaker A: That's my favorite question you've ever asked. Well, I can see what danger.
Speaker B: That's clearly you all. Clearly, you all are trying to keep us out, and you've tagged us on the top end, and where are you going to step in on the bottom.
Speaker A: End and try to block.
Speaker B: I'm just trying to figure out. I'm trying to figure out at what point what are the. What's the sandbox that I have to play is really what I'm trying to define.
Speaker A: Oh, man. Okay, well, that's. That's good information. So we. We know, Eli, we. We both got to be there at the same time, actually, before. For us, before we go to Ireland. We go to Ireland the end of July. So we've got a. We've. July 22. We've got to be the drop dead date. Okay. And then do you. Can you just pick any qualifying site? Yep.
Speaker E: So when you go on to sign up, obviously, all of our qualifiers are filled in a first come, first serve basis. So I would say, anecdotally speaking, the four ball is probably our most popular championship. And so a lot of qualifying sites will fill up. I mean, sometimes in a matter of minutes. So if you wait till end of July, you all might be going somewhere not close to where you currently live.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker E: Maybe as soon as we get off this podcast, I'd go start practicing and try to get that handicap done.
Speaker A: So there's a chance. There's a chance we get there at the end of July and there's no spots left?
Speaker E: There'll be spots, but you may be. You maybe have to travel to Alaska.
Speaker A: Is there anything else that we don't know that we should know about the process? You know, because we're fairly new to this, we haven't played much tournament golf.
Speaker E: So I would say with the four ball championship as an example, I think we have around 50 sites across the country. And again, with it being our most popular championship, most of the sites will be full. And so, typically on a given qualifier, there'll be anywhere from 40 to 50 teams, usually playing for two spots. So you play for two spots and two alternate.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker E: Having gone through the research this past year, I believe the average score to advance to the championship from the four ball qualifying was around 67. Now, that's a team competition, so you don't have to shoot 67 on your own ball. You can ham an egg. But, yeah, 67 in competition is about what it'll take to get through.
Speaker A: So, Eli, do you remember what we shot at tobacco road in our four ball?
Speaker B: What was our, what was our score?
Speaker A: 67.
Speaker E: There you go. No joke either. So.
Speaker A: I know, I mean, I'm just already, I'm just saying, I'm just saying, Brent.
Speaker B: Is there the ability to push us knowing that we're probably going to put up 267? Can you go ahead and push us through without having to qualify?
Speaker E: Well, you know, I would say what are partly what our team administers is a special exemption process. So you're certainly welcome to, you know, request a special exemption, submit your resume playing accomplishments, and we'll certainly review that.
Speaker A: Can you picture that?
Speaker B: What would go on that resume?
Speaker A: I had a couple birdies last year, we shot a 67 in a made up tournament. Okay. All right, one more question maybe, Brent, since you are a baller, since you, since you can play, do you have any tips? You have any tips for us? Cause I mean, we just haven't played much tournament golf in general.
Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, I would say a couple of things. Certainly, you know, your local state associations, so Carolina's golf association, obviously, they run a ton of events, great events, everything from one day events to their state championships. But even before that, you know, I think the advice always, I always give is if you're going to go out and play around to golf, is to try to make it mean something and try to learn something from it. So whether that's, you know, playing a $2 Nassau, playing against yourself, you know, trying to, you know, hit twelve greens instead of eleven, whatever it might be, and I'm certainly as guilty as anyone where, you know, if you go out there and you're not, you don't really have something to play for playing about, then you're just kind of out there and you may as well get a score of the range at that point because you're not really achieving much. So I have a two year old now, and so obviously time is very limited. And so, yeah, if I'm going to play, you know, spend four and a half hours, 5 hours on the golf course, I'm going to make sure that it's, every ounce of that is valuable. So it varies for everyone. Everyone has obviously different motivations, but that's usually the advice I give, is just to try to, whenever you're out there, try to make it mean something.
Speaker A: I like that. I like that. And we, and we have to do that now, Eli, because we have to, we have to get to 2.4 as quick as possible. We're going to Alaska. Do you have qualifiers in Alaska?
Speaker E: We do have some qualifiers. Alaska. Not a four ball, but we do have some USA qualifiers.
Speaker A: Okay. That'd be kind of cool. A little Timothy Treadwell.
Speaker B: Sort of actors get eaten by bears.
Speaker A: Old Brent. Thank you so much, man. We really appreciate you coming on.
Speaker E: Absolutely. Thanks, guys, and best of luck. I look forward to following your progress and if the handicap limits drop again, you'll know exactly why.
Speaker A: Kudos to Brent for the great conversation, having a great sense of humor. We're going to keep the villain music, though, just for motivational purposes. Hope you understand. Once Brent dropped off the call, Eli and I stayed on and reacted now with full knowledge of what was in front of us. I mean.
Speaker B: Well, there's no. I mean, there's no.
Speaker A: There's no easy way out.
Speaker B: It's basically. Basically, we're in Russia. Basically, the USGA is driving around in spy car in the snow while we're trying to train and get better. Well, look, there's no. There's no ambiguity now.
Speaker A: No. Like it's. Get to 2.4 on the same time frame. Yeah. As quickly as possible. Yeah. I mean. So it's a race. It's. It's. It's a. It's a race to get to 2.4.
Speaker B: There is no chance. There's no chance we don't qualify for this four ball thing. I'm just saying it right now.
Speaker A: I love it. I love.
Speaker B: I love it. Just saying it right now.
Speaker A: Talk like that.
Speaker D: I love it.
Speaker A: I love to hear it. Just to clarify, we know there's absolutely a chance we don't qualify. We have the same time challenges we've had in the past six seasons, and now we have a very specific result that both of us have to achieve in a very specific time frame. We would both need to drop a point and a half from our start of season handicaps in four months to even be eligible for the tournament we want to qualify for. But perhaps it's no coincidence that on the same day we decided this would be our season seven goal, actually, just hours afterwards, that's when we had the privilege to interview Carl Weathers. And you might remember what he said.
Speaker G: I mean, look, you know you better than anybody knows you, so don't lie to yourself. If you need work, go get the work done, man. Go for it. You know what I mean? Shoeing up is not enough. It's just not. I'm sorry, folks. It's not enough. What are you going to do after you get there? What are you going to do with all that energy, with the life God has given you? What are you going to do with it? My advice to anybody is just go after it and go after it with as much love and as energy and as much passion as you have.
Speaker A: After hearing that, how could we not go for it? The quest to qualify begins next time on chasing scratch. Thank you so much for listening to us today.

Music credits are in the show notes and we'll be back for episode two of season seven next week with what.
Speaker B: You'Re saying about the four ball being the most popular, theoretically, you know, more people to try to knock out. What part of the country do you think have the worst golfers? Where we should go try to qualify?
Speaker E: I would say it probably depends on the time of year.
Speaker B: Brent, I'm just kidding.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker B: That'd be great, though, for the USGA to come out and be like, you know, we've done a lot of research.
Speaker A: Mississippi sucks.
Speaker B: Go qualify in Mississippi.
Speaker A: Go to Mississippi. There's a bunch of vanity handicaps. You'll be fine. I'm just kidding, Everett. I'm just kidding, Everett. Don't worry. We know Everett is Mississippi. Who's a lawyer who could sue us.
