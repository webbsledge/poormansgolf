Speaker A: We are two guys in our mid thirties. We have wives, kids, jobs, adult responsibilities, and shaky eleven handicaps. And we're trying to get those handicaps to scratch in a year. This is chasing scratch. Episode one of pact.
Speaker B: August 20. Are we. Are we really doing this?
Speaker A: I think so.
Speaker B: For those of you who might be listening, if this ends up going to a viewing or listening audience, we have just embarked on a mission that essentially has no positive outcome. Am I wrong? Am I wrong in that?
Speaker A: No. No. Come on, now. We are in a positive place right now. At least we were a couple days ago before we really thought about what this actually means.
Speaker B: But hearing. But hearing it now, I mean, actually saying, we're chasing scratch. And you know what that means. You know, what comes with getting to scratch? I mean, I don't. It needs to be said. But you know what I'm getting ready to say.
Speaker A: This was us seven months ago, having our first conversation about this idea in August of 2017. So it's now March of 2018. And before we go any further, we just wanted to briefly interrupt and do some quick intros. So my name is Mike.
Speaker B: I'm Eli.
Speaker A: And just to give you a very quick background on how we know each other, we met in college. It was 19 years ago, and in college, honestly, we were friends. We played a little bit of golf, but really, afterwards, I'd say our friendship is based basically around golf. Eli lives in Kentucky. I live in North Carolina, but we see each other about four to five times a year. And they're all golf trips.
Speaker B: Yeah. We've basically convinced our wives to allow us to take couples trips together. These are essentially golf trips that are now masquerading as couples trips.
Speaker A: So we love golf, and I guess the USGA would say we're above average.
Speaker B: But we are anything but average when it comes to the numerous golf trips that we take together. During the average year, actually, within about the first six holes of any golf trip, our swings have completely decayed. And so this is ultimately what drove us to say something has to change. We're tired of getting together and being completely depressed. The first round in. On any given golf trip, it's time for a higher pursuit. It's time to chase scratch. But this pursuit comes with one gigantic caveat. The one thing we agreed was that we were unwilling to. To chase scratch if it meant becoming deadbeat husbands, terrible fathers, and horrible employees. This had to be done in a way that maintained the integrity of all those relationships, and it also had to be done with a working man's budget. There was going to be no hiring of swing coaches, quitting our jobs, cashing in our 401 ks, and moving to Florida.
Speaker A: Yeah, that's a good point. And so what we did was we actually, when we started, we. We recorded everything. We recorded all the conversations that we had about golf. We. We recorded swing thoughts. We recorded in match thoughts. We recorded. Tried to record some lessons. And I guess in the back of our minds, we thought maybe we would make it a podcast, but one, we didn't know if we would continue to. We didn't know if it was going to be interesting. I guess we still don't know if it's going to be interesting, but we're putting it out there anyway. Today's episode, we're going to play you some of our first conversations to help give you some background. And then we're going to interject periodically throughout with these whoosh sounds. The whoosh sound will basically indicate that we're moving back and forth between present day and past conversations. But basically, the plan is our first three to four episodes are going to be background of what we've done so far from there. After we get caught up, we'll pick up live and we will plan to update every time our handicap revises. So that's every two weeks. But for right now, let's go back to August. So what is your handicap right now? I don't even know.
Speaker B: My handicap is an eleven six.
Speaker A: What.
Speaker B: What are you?
Speaker A: I'm an eleven three. So we're essentially just about the same. Okay.
Speaker B: Which makes sense.
Speaker A: That's.
Speaker B: That's 20 years of our golf games have pretty much been dead. Even.
Speaker A: So we have a year. Let's give us. Let's give us more than a year. How about we go to the end of next golf season? Because it's.
Speaker C: So.
Speaker A: It's August 20, 2017. Right now. What's. What's the end of the golf season? Probably the end of October.
Speaker B: Probably?
Speaker A: Yes. Can you still play golf in October in Kentucky? Yeah. You get.
Speaker B: There's some sneaky days in there.
Speaker A: Okay, so Halloween? You wanna do Halloween?
Speaker B: I like it.
Speaker A: All right, so October 31, 2018. That is the end of this experiment. It sounds stupid when we're talking. Just right now, when we're talking about it. Like the other day when we. When we started talking about this, I really felt positive about it, and it just feels like that's. It's not gonna happen right now. I need to be talked back into positivity land.
Speaker B: It felt great until we started realizing that it's gonna take a couple rounds under par, which sounds like the most ridiculous thing on the face of the earth, given not just the current state of our golf games, but the history of our golf swings.
Speaker A: Yeah, it's not been good, but here's. But here's one way to look at it. Okay, I'm gonna talk myself back into positivity.
Speaker B: All right, I'm on board. Bring us.
Speaker A: After taking a turn towards negative town, let us bring us back to positivity. What you could say is we've made all the mistakes. So I can say that I've tried to rebuild my swing by watching the golf channel and reading golf digest and setting up nets in my living room, and that hasn't worked. And I've bought. I bought new clubs that were too good for me. And we've. We've tried so much crap over the years that hasn't worked. And I feel like we're wiser than we were.
Speaker B: I want to believe that. I'm going to believe that.
Speaker A: I really do believe that. I believe that we've made the stupid mistakes. You've bought some terrible things off the Golf channel. You're welcome.
Speaker B: Jim Sauerwine.
Speaker A: The inside approach. The inside approach that actually destroyed my game for two years just because you had me try it three times. But we're. But we're not going to get into that. It's just going to make me mad. That's how a lot of our conversations sound. We go back and forth between how stupid this idea is. And then as resilient golfers, we come back to the fact that this is possible. Yeah.
Speaker B: So we've realized this is actually a superpower that we possess. It's the ability to go from negative town to positive town in a matter of seconds, and even in ways that make absolutely no sense to any other human beings on the planet. What you just heard was a perfect example. In one breath, we talked about how we had done absolutely everything wrong in a pursuit of getting better at golf. But in doing everything possible in the wrong way, it actually equipped us in the perfect way to get to scratch. It's thoughts like this that are completely out of touch with reality that actually equip us to make this pursuit.
Speaker A: If every instinct you have is wrong, the opposite would be correct.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: So we. Then, after we determined that we were going to do this basically, no matter what, we thought we should tell some people about this and get their honest feedback.
Speaker B: These next two friends of ours are Collier and Jason. We've known them both for a long time. We've played numerous rounds of golf. And even attended several golf trips together. They're very familiar with our swings and with our games.
Speaker A: Yeah, and listen to them struggle to be direct with us out of just sheer sensitivity to our feelings.
Speaker B: So you're assigned. You're assigning 0% probability to this?
Speaker C: No, a legit scratch golfer. There's no chip.
Speaker B: And you legitimately, all jokes aside, you think seven is the ceiling for me? For you and a nine for me.
Speaker C: Nine? Yeah. You can't get below a nine. And you. But you said you were at a seven at one point.
Speaker B: I was at a seven a year.
Speaker C: Ago, but I have to see who's keeping your score. Are we playing? Is this like legitimate golf?
Speaker B: Like.
Speaker C: No mulligans?
Speaker B: No two off the.
Speaker C: No two off the first?
Speaker A: This is legit golf.
Speaker C: No. No chance.
Speaker D: My initial knee jerk thought is that you absolutely have no prayer of ever. Unless you divorce your wives, sell your children, and pay a lot of money for a lot of private lessons, four to five times a week, that's your only chance of even getting to a two or a three.
Speaker C: Wow.
Speaker D: Okay, I know that's brutal, but I mean, I'm being. If you want honest feedback, you ask for honest feedback. I'm not putting on a show here. I mean, you have no prayer.
Speaker A: Now, the people who know my game the best, and actually Eli's game too, are my dad and brother. They're the people I play with the most. So one night on a visit with the family, I asked them what they thought about this idea.
Speaker E: See, the problem here is you and Eli are chasing a dream because your bodies have already crossed the line. You are so old that you can't. You can't do this now. You had to do this earlier in your lives.
Speaker A: But I thought you said that. You used to tell me that thirties was the place where you played your best golf.
Speaker E: That was. Sexually, I think I'd be a little more optimistic and say, you can do it, but at what cost? I think you're gonna have to sacrifice something.
Speaker A: But no, but that's the point. You can't. So the only thing.
Speaker E: You can still have a family if you're divorced. You just have to loosen up the. The definitions. I think you'd get to a six.
Speaker A: Six?
Speaker E: I think Eli can get to a ten.
Speaker A: Why do you say Eli get to a ten?
Speaker E: I was just joking.
Speaker A: No, you weren't.
Speaker E: No, I weren't.
Speaker A: But after getting his initial jokes out of the way, dad actually got serious and laid down some wisdom.
Speaker E: I actually think this is. That's an excellent and terrible idea all at the same time. It's good balance. It's an excellent idea because you're really at the right time of life to do it and it'd be fun to do it. You've got a timeframe beginning and an end, and at the end of that you can decide whether you thought it was a good idea or not. It's a terrible idea if for somehow this pursuit ruins your love of the game. It's a game you get to play your whole life. The last thing you'd want to do is throw that away because being 142 years old myself, I do love playing golf.
Speaker A: My dad brings up a really good point here, and we're actually going to talk about this in some later episodes. But for right now, let's go back to August.
Speaker B: So let, so let me ask you this. Now that we've officially, we've thrown it out there, it's. It's out what? Realistically, if this was a Vegas.
Speaker A: If.
Speaker B: If Vegas was coming in right now and they were going to set. They were going to set the line on where our handicap gets to for an over under, where do you think Vegas would put your handicap?
Speaker A: Six? Five and a half. And a half. Five and a half.
Speaker B: And. And what would you take?
Speaker A: I would take right now. I'd take the under because I think just. I think we can do this.
Speaker B: I think it's possible just because of pure optimism.
Speaker A: Pure. We're sitting in pure optimism range right now. So I'm saying five and a half. What would you say?
Speaker B: I think. I think four. I think four and a half was the number I had in mind. Because you've been. I mean, if you figure you've been an eight, which was basically the lowest I've been, I cracked a seven. Nine last year was the lowest I got. So we basically. Our ceiling has basically hit the same exact point at some point in our past lives. And if you think back to how you were playing, I could have easily trimmed four strokes around off when I was an eight just from being an idiot.
Speaker A: Right.
Speaker B: So I don't. I think. I think if we commit, I think four is, is realistic.
Speaker A: All right, so that's the situation. Now, I do have to ask a question because I've. I've known you for a number of years and we have. We have. What's the right way to say this? We have gone on journeys before. We have made packs before, and I feel like I am more likely to carry on through with the pact potentially than you are. Granted, this is mostly around pacts related to dieting and working out which. Golf is way more fun than either of those. So maybe that doesn't apply, but I just have to throw it out there because I don't want to be alone. I don't want to be like Costanza asking about the pact, and then you just say, all I did was shake your hand.
Speaker B: I think you're looking at this all wrong. You view my starting a diet every other week and quitting it by Tuesday as a failure. You view that as inconsistency. You view the fact that as you've. As you've referred to many times, you've referred to the fact that my blood type is high fructose corn syrup. High fructose corn syrup. You view those as inconsistencies in my dieting, but I would look at it the other way. Since you've known me, have my eating habits changed since I've been an 18 year old? Up until the point I've been a 36 year old?
Speaker A: No, you're right about that.
Speaker B: I think I'm extremely consistent, and I'm consistent in quitting diets very early on, which is also consistency. This is more important. My health is irrelevant. You know, that has. That is completely unimportant. Golf is what's really important.
Speaker A: That is true. So, but just to seal it, and I just having. I think I just had this thought. Just to seal it, do we need to have a match at the end of this for some serious stakes? An 18 hole match at the end of this? So it would be in October of 2018. That is the. Basically the winner of this experiment.
Speaker B: Oh, I like this idea.
Speaker A: Well, I guess the winner of the experiment. Experiment might be the one with the lowest handicap.
Speaker B: But then, yeah, I think this is just further. This is just a further. This is. This is like the FedEx cup at the end of the season. Right.
Speaker A: But this is.
Speaker B: This is just a further. Cement the champion.
Speaker A: But I think there needs to be some serious stakes on the line, like should.
Speaker B: Should stake be on the line?
Speaker A: Maybe it is a steak. I like that. A steak dinner at a nice place like Mike Mendy's.
Speaker B: Or is it something golf related? Is it. Do you have to wear something to the course the next time we play together? Does the loser have to wear something that the winner picks?
Speaker A: I like that. But I don't know if that's serious enough, because that's not really gonna bother me. I think. I think whatever this stake is, it's gotta affect the pocket.
Speaker B: What, what about this? Yeah. The next time we make. I don't even know if I want to say this. Cause it just scares me. The next golf trip, the loser pays.
Speaker A: For the whole golf trip.
Speaker B: That's freaking terrifying.
Speaker A: I love it. I mean, I don't love it, but at the same time, I love it.
Speaker B: That's gotta be enough to keep you. I mean, beyond just the love of golf, that fear alone has to be enough to keep you going.
Speaker A: And that will be the most pressure packed 18 holes ever.
Speaker B: There's no way we shoot anything better than 25 over par in that round.
Speaker A: Okay, just to interject quickly, this bet has actually changed about six times since we first made it. It currently stands as this. If either of us gets to scratch, that person wins. If neither of us gets to scratch, the winner of this now four round cumulative stroke play event will be declared the winner.
Speaker B: So, one more thing we did in this first conversation. We felt like there needed to be a forum where we could be extremely critical, extremely direct with each other, identify the issues that we saw, and do it in a way where we had no regard for the other person's feelings. So out of this came what we now call honesty hour.
Speaker A: Do we ever have regard for the other person's feelings?
Speaker B: No, not at all.
Speaker A: Should we call it honesty hour? Is there a better name for it? Honesty hour?
Speaker B: No, I like.
Speaker A: I like it. In honesty hour, I'm able to tell you why you are failing, and you get to tell me why I am failing. Or just. I guess you could say something positive, but that doesn't feel like us.
Speaker B: This is like Festivus. Does honesty hour not end until someone's pinned?
Speaker A: So the. So basically, you just take it. I just take a shot at your game. But it's not meant to. It's not meant to hurt you. It's meant to help you.
Speaker B: These are the wounds of a friend. They're meant to make me stronger.
Speaker A: That's right. That's right. Okay.
Speaker B: I like it. Why don't you kick it off then?
Speaker A: Okay. Your putter sucks.
Speaker B: Now, I don't want you to hold back. I want you to say what you feel.
Speaker A: All right, so I need to describe your putter.
Speaker B: Here's the thing. My putter knew you were going to say that. First of all.
Speaker A: First of all, it's called the prophet.
Speaker B: That's why it knew you were going to say that.
Speaker A: Wait, is it the prophet or prophecy?
Speaker B: I think it's prophecy.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker B: I'm not sure. It's written in Sanskrit, right? No one's. No one's been able to interpret it.
Speaker A: Yet. So your putter looks like it. Here's what your putter looks like. It looks like it came out of. Have you seen those complete sets of golf clubs they sell at Walmart? In the box? It looks like it's a putter out of one of those bags where the putter matches all the rest of the clubs. And just. Just to get the sense it's copper. There's cop. There's a copper insert.
Speaker B: It's a copper sleeve. Brett Favre wears one.
Speaker A: So I'm just. I'm just gonna throw it out there. If you're gonna be serious, like, about this. I can't. I just can't imagine you shooting under par with a copper fit putter. And I think. I think you need to think seriously about getting an actual brand.
Speaker B: Well, first of all, the prophecy is a brand, okay? It's not a very good one, but it is a brand. All right. I will tell you. I will receive that moment of honesty. I agree with you. The prophecy was found in a moment of weakness. Last year before our golf trip in October, when I went looking for a counterbalanced upright putter and I went to look at a scotty Cameron, for some reason, I settled on the prophecy as a slight step down. But I will receive that moment of honesty. And that one's going to be. I'm not going to lie. That one's going to be hard to part with. But I think you're right. I do need a putter, if nothing else, just to mentally. Just to mentally say to myself that I'm serious about getting better at putting.
Speaker A: Wow. You took that well. I did. I did.
Speaker B: You're right. I have nothing to argue. You have 20 years of understanding my putting history. What do I have to stand behind?
Speaker A: Not much. I'm glad. We're glad we're on the same page there. Okay.
Speaker B: All right. My moment of honesty for you. You need to learn how to. You need to learn how to hit a driver like a man. You need to be aggressive off the tee box instead of hitting three iron everywhere.
Speaker A: I'm going to agree. I'm going to wholeheartedly agree with you.
Speaker B: So describe right now your mentality when you step on a tee box.
Speaker A: Well, I'm trying to think back to the last. It might have. It might be ten years ago, the last time I've actually consistently could hit my driver straight, that it might have been persimmon. I don't. I don't know. I don't know if they'd gone to the meadow woods when. When I hit, could hit driver, strike. But it's been. It is the weak part of my game. And for some reason, I can hit long irons pretty well, probably because I got so used to them being in the woods after hitting driver. And I hit knockdown three hit, knock down three irons through the trees.
Speaker B: You do. You do have the greatest punch three iron I've ever witnessed.
Speaker A: That's my. That's my game. But that's a big, big thing holding me back, because when I'm trying to score, I really have to go to a three iron off the tee because that's the only thing that's going to keep me in play. But that leaves. That leaves too much pressure on the mid to long irons coming in on most of the courses that we play. So that's going to be difficult for me to achieve, achieve these goals without being able to hit driver. So now I will say I did just get fitted for. I fitted for a driver two weeks ago. First time I ever got fitted for a driver. And plan on taking it out for the first time in a couple days when this thing starts, so we'll see. All right, but. But I'm. I appreciate that honesty, and I'm in complete agreement.
Speaker B: Just. Just to follow up on this, to describe what I've seen out of your driver swings over the years. Your driver swing was where we invented the term sosa, which was when, if anyone has seen Sammy Sosa hit a. Hit a home run, he essentially drops his bat three quarters of the way through the swing in celebration. You did the opposite. You weren't celebrating. It was more just a complete loss of any sort of control over what was happening. And at one point. At one point, I counted, I said an over under on how many times your club would be dropped in the middle of your. Of your follow through.
Speaker A: Yeah, and I went over. All right, all right.
Speaker B: I feel I'm.
Speaker A: I feel.
Speaker B: I feel lighter. I feel better now.
Speaker A: All right, so one other question. How public is this packed in your household?
Speaker B: I'm hunkered down into my office with the doors closed, and I'm hiding and recording this under a desk. So, needless to say, this pact has not yet went public in the household.
Speaker A: Okay? So I think I'm doing the same thing, but I think I will record when I tell my wife about this pact.
Speaker B: Yes, I agree. I'll do the same thing.
Speaker A: All right, so I want to get your thoughts on something.
Speaker F: Okay.
Speaker A: Eli and I are going to start a mission for a year. Do you want to know what the mission is. Or do you care?
Speaker F: Oh, no.
Speaker A: Do you care?
Speaker F: Do you care? No, I care. Let me know about it.
Speaker A: Okay, here's the mission. So we are, we are above average golfers. Average golfers probably like a, like me.
Speaker F: No, I'm above average in everything.
Speaker A: You're above average.
Speaker F: Talent, looks.
Speaker A: Yes, that's true. But probably not golf.
Speaker F: So wittiness.
Speaker A: Wittiness, yes, but we are, we are eleven handicaps. Do you know what that means?
Speaker F: Yes, it means that there are eleven things that you can't do.
Speaker A: Yes, we have eleven specific things that we can't do on the golf course. No, eleven handicap means we normally. Simplest way to say is we normally shoot well, like eleven over par. So the. So our quest is to become scratch golfers in a year. Scratch golfers means. Means you average, even par, basically.
Speaker F: So it's going to be difficult is the word you're looking for.
Speaker A: Yes. Impossible. Not, well, no, impossible things. Impossible.
Speaker F: Yeah, no, I think you can do it. I definitely do. I'm just like, I know that you guys have the ability to do it. Obviously I don't. Okay. I know that you guys could have the ability to do it, but you have to get out there and do it. You have to actually go to the course.
Speaker A: It's a matter of when. Like, when do you do these things.
Speaker B: With the little bit that you know about golf? What does your gut instinct tell you?
Speaker G: Um, I think. Are you talking about you or in general?
Speaker B: Me?
Speaker G: Okay. I think that when you put your mind to something and it is priority, like putting aside, you know, being a good dad and a good husband, not putting it above that, but, you know, like you can give up watching this basketball game. If you can do that, then, yeah, you'll have plenty of time.
Speaker B: How would you describe my ability to keep a commitment? We've been married over ten years now. How would you describe my ability to keep a commitment? Like, for instance, if I commit to a diet or a health plan.
Speaker G: Oh, well, it depends on what you're committing to, because a diet or a health plan, it's like a roller coaster, let's be honest.
Speaker B: What's something I've committed to that I've.
Speaker G: Kept, that you can remember, your love for me.
Speaker B: It's true. So what do you, what do you assign? If you had to assign a probability of me achieving this, what would it be? 100%, 50%? And what's the zero?
Speaker G: Okay, what's the time frame? A year, one year?
Speaker B: Knowing, by the way, knowing that four months of the year, I'm not going to be able to play.
Speaker G: And this is committing how much each.
Speaker B: Day it's practice in the house, whenever I can get to the range without disrupting life. Here was the deal. We were going to become a scratch. We weren't going to. We weren't going to go out and play old time and miss time with our family. It was like, you have to fit it around that. What do you think the odds are of me hitting this now?
Speaker G: This is a high percentage, but I've gotta be realistic. I'm gonna go with 75%.
Speaker B: Gosh, you do love me, don't you?
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker G: 75% to 80%.
Speaker A: Wow.
Speaker B: I mean, okay.
Speaker G: I mean, you can't say perfect.
Speaker B: Cause I'd probably put it at like zero, but that's okay. But that's your love for me.
Speaker G: Yeah. I'm committed, too.
Speaker B: As you can tell, these women take their marriage vows very, very seriously. Either they believe in us way too much, or they know way too little about golf.
Speaker A: I just gotta say, I think we picked some good spouses.
Speaker B: Yes, we did.
Speaker A: So today we've talked about the idea, the background, and why we're doing this. But how are we going to do this? That's next week on chasing scratch. Thanks for listening today. Please subscribe to the podcast and leave a review. We'd love to hear the feedback. You can follow us on Twitter acingscratch. Zero, our website is chasing scratch.net dot.
